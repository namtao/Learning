00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:07.910
In today's lesson, we're going to talk
about what a terminal emulator is and

2
00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.420
a few different methods on how to
gain access to a Linux system.

3
00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.340
If you already access to a Linux system,
feel free to skip ahead.

4
00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.940
A terminal is a hardware device that
allows you to enter data into a computer

5
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.170
and for
that computer to display data back to you.

6
00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.280
In the past, terminals were
typically connected to computers or

7
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.980
servers via a cable of some sort,
typically a serial cable.

8
00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.060
Terminals themselves actually
look like computers.

9
00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:39.060
They have a keyboard for entering in data,
a display to display the data back.

10
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.770
The big difference between a terminal and
a computer is

11
00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:46.420
that a terminal is worthless unless it's
connected to a real computer or a server.

12
00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.410
This is why you'll sometimes hear
terminals referred to as dumb terminals.

13
00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.340
Today, terminals are obsolete.

14
00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.910
We still need to enter
data into a computer and

15
00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.800
allow a computer to display data back
to us, but the technology has changed.

16
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.760
Instead of using a terminal to connect
to a Linux server, what we do today

17
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.670
is use a terminal emulator application
that acts as if it were the terminal.

18
00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.592
You can use a terminal emulator
application to communicate with your local

19
00:01:14.592 --> 00:01:15.221
computer.

20
00:01:15.221 --> 00:01:18.703
For instance, if you were running
Linux as your primary desktop and

21
00:01:18.703 --> 00:01:22.371
you are using a graphical user interface,
you could start up a terminal

22
00:01:22.371 --> 00:01:26.820
emulator application in order to
interact with a command line of Linux.

23
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.278
If you are using Windows As you primary
desktop, you could start a terminal

24
00:01:31.278 --> 00:01:35.475
emulator application and connect to
a Linux server over the network.

25
00:01:35.475 --> 00:01:38.348
In order to practice the skills
you'll be gaining in this course,

26
00:01:38.348 --> 00:01:40.415
you're going to need
access to a Linux system.

27
00:01:40.415 --> 00:01:45.065
One quick and easy way to do that
is to open up a web browser and

28
00:01:45.065 --> 00:01:48.136
visit http://simpleshell.com.

29
00:01:48.136 --> 00:01:51.500
Http://simpleshell.com allows you
to connect to a Linux server.

30
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.770
You just click start my session,
and a terminal emulator opens up.

31
00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.840
Each session is limited to 15 minutes, so

32
00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.140
if you just wanna spend just a couple of
minutes trying out a new command that

33
00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.550
you're learning about, this would
be a great way to practice that.

34
00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.754
A couple of alternatives to simpleshell
include webminal like terminal,

35
00:02:09.754 --> 00:02:10.638
except for web.

36
00:02:10.638 --> 00:02:14.166
Webminal.org.

37
00:02:14.166 --> 00:02:18.530
And linuxzoo.net.

38
00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.490
If you have your own website, you very
well may have access to a Linux account.

39
00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.160
Many times here,
hosting providers use Linux

40
00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.180
as the operating system which
runs their web servers.

41
00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.430
Look at your web hosting company's
documentation and look for

42
00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.680
the words shell access or SSH.

43
00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.710
SSH stands for secure shell.

44
00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.190
And SSH is a network protocol.

45
00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.608
It allows you to take your
terminal emulator application and

46
00:02:46.608 --> 00:02:49.230
connect it over the network
to a Linux server.

47
00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.270
Shared web hosting is
typically inexpensive.

48
00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.110
It's usually only a few dollars a month.

49
00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.660
Some of the same companies that provide
web hosting services also provide

50
00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.230
virtual private servers,
sometimes called VPS for short.

51
00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.080
These virtual private servers run
complete operating systems and

52
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.640
they are not shared So, only you have an
account for this entire operating system.

53
00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.510
And you can do anything with this
virtual server that you could a real

54
00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:16.920
physical server.

55
00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.250
Again, since it's not shared and
you have full control over the server,

56
00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.440
you can reboot it at will.

57
00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.950
This is not such a good thing if you're
in a shared hosting environment.

58
00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.639
That's why your accounts in those
environments have limited access.

59
00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.360
If you like the idea of having full
control over a virtual server,

60
00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.020
you could look into
cloud computing as well.

61
00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.340
In cloud speak,
a virtual server is called an instance.

62
00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.470
You'll hear people talking
about spinning up an instance.

63
00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.850
That simply means they've deployed
a virtual server running a complete

64
00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.370
operating system.

65
00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.320
One of the main differences between cloud
providers and traditional web hosting

66
00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:55.870
providers that provide shared hosting and
virtual private servers

67
00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.710
is that cloud servers or cloud instances
can be programmatically deployed.

68
00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:04.510
That means you can create software
that starts cloud instances or

69
00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.410
stops cloud instances.

70
00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:09.220
In our case,
we just want access to a Linux server so

71
00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.430
you don't have to take advantage of
those features if you don't want them.

72
00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.650
Just know that VPS, a virtual
private server or a cloud server or

73
00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.540
a cloud instance are all the same thing.

74
00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.188
Another way to get access to a Linux
server is to run a Live Linux

75
00:04:25.188 --> 00:04:26.220
distribution.

76
00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:33.063
A Live Linux distro typically runs
from CD or USB key or a DVD-ROM.

77
00:04:33.063 --> 00:04:36.421
You insert the bootable media,
start your hardware and

78
00:04:36.421 --> 00:04:42.210
in just a few minutes you are placed into
a live running Linux operating system.

79
00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.700
The reason why they are called Live Linux
distributions is they do not write to your

80
00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:46.220
hard drive.

81
00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.140
They are not installed on your computer.

82
00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:49.180
They are just live.

83
00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.570
So they run as long as the power is on.

84
00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.740
The minute you reboot your computer
your operating system is gone,

85
00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.590
the advantage of using a Live Linux
distribution is that you

86
00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.440
can try something out without
modifying your computer.

87
00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.330
The disadvantage of using a Live Linux
distribution is that when you're using it

88
00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:08.740
you don't have access to your
primary operating system.

89
00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.740
For example, if you were watching
this course on your Windows pc and

90
00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.760
you wanted to try a few new Linux
commands that you've learned about,

91
00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:19.410
you would have to stop your Windows
operating system, put in a CD, and

92
00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:22.480
power up the computer again
in order to boot into Linux.

93
00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.330
It's important to keep in mind that
Live Linux Distro shouldn't be used to

94
00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.640
evaluate the performance of Linux.

95
00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:32.540
When you're running a Live distro, you're
typically running it from a storage device

96
00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.860
that is a lot slower than
your normal hard drive.

97
00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:40.850
A few Live Linux Distributions that
are fairly popular include Fedora,

98
00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:44.450
Knoppix, Puppy Linux and Ubuntu.

99
00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:47.980
Live Linux distros by default do
not modify your system in anyway.

100
00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:50.450
They won't write to your hard drive for
instance.

101
00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:53.900
However most Live Linux
distributions do include a utility

102
00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:57.550
to install the distro to your hard
drive if you decide you like it.

103
00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:00.560
Of course you can always
install Linux on a computer.

104
00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:05.010
If you have an extra laptop, or
an old PC that you're not using anymore,

105
00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:08.680
then took a Linux distribution and
install it directly on that.

106
00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:12.390
If you do decide to install Linux
yourself, don't worry if there are things

107
00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:15.480
in the installation process
that don't make sense, or

108
00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.500
that you don't fully understand.

109
00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.710
Typically, the defaults are pretty safe.

110
00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:22.557
Just accept the defaults and
you should be good to go.

111
00:06:22.557 --> 00:06:25.800
The last method I'm going
to talk about today

112
00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:30.530
is using pre-installed Linux
images with VirtualBox.

113
00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:34.200
This is the method that I recommend
you use with this course.

114
00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:37.300
VirtualBox is virtualization software.

115
00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.850
It allows you to run entire operating
systems within your current

116
00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:42.500
operating system.

117
00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:47.880
Your current operating system is called
the host or the host operating system and

118
00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:51.390
the virtual machines that you'll
be creating are called guests.

119
00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:55.710
Like Linux, VirtualBox is free and
open source software.

120
00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:59.930
VirtualBox runs on Mac,
Windows and even Linux.

121
00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:03.120
In the next part of the course, I will
show you how to install VirtualBox on

122
00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:06.330
windows and also how to install it on Mac.

123
00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:10.380
From there I will show you how to get
the pre-installed Linux images and

124
00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:12.510
how to import those into VirtualBox.

125
00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:15.640
Then we can get started with
the main course content.

126
00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:20.680
The ways to get access to a Linux system
include going to simpleshell.com,

127
00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:24.570
in your web browser,
using a hosting provider,

128
00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:29.510
be that a shared web host,
a VPS host or a cloud host.

129
00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:33.203
You can install Linux on hardware, and

130
00:07:33.203 --> 00:07:36.111
you can also run Linux
inside a virtual machine.
