2
00:00:09.505 --> 00:00:15.377
Today's video will show you how to install
virtualization software that will allow

3
00:00:15.377 --> 00:00:20.760
you to install guest operating systems and
also how to install Ubuntu Linux.

4
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:29.700
To get started,
let's go to virtualbox.org.

5
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.300
And click on Downloads.

6
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.049
This is the virtualization software
that we're going to be using.

7
00:00:36.376 --> 00:00:41.292
And then you select your platform,
in this case I'm using Windows as

8
00:00:41.292 --> 00:00:46.120
my host operating system and so
I would click this link here.

9
00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:52.500
You could also install VirtualBox
on Linux, on Mac, or even Solaris.

10
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.990
I've already downloaded this.

11
00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:59.960
So I'm going to just pull it up right
now and then double-click to run it.

12
00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.835
And I'm just going to accept the defaults.

13
00:01:03.835 --> 00:01:10.970
Click Next Next again.

14
00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:11.596
That looks fine,

15
00:01:24.234 --> 00:01:26.845
Go in to click Install and
do the same thing for

16
00:01:26.845 --> 00:01:29.262
all the messages like this in the future.

17
00:01:46.593 --> 00:01:48.564
Click Finish to complete the installation.

18
00:01:53.298 --> 00:01:54.965
And then we'll restart later.

19
00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:01.490
So the next piece of software we need
to install Ubuntu is Ubuntu itself.

20
00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:08.690
So we'll go to ubuntu.com,
find the download link.

21
00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.710
And then here we have a couple
of different options.

22
00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.960
The primary options are Ubuntu Desktop and
Ubuntu Server.

23
00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.980
The primary difference between Desktop and
Server is that the desktop

24
00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.410
edition provides a graphical user
environment, whereas the server does not.

25
00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.370
Ubuntu Server is best for things like
web servers or database servers or

26
00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.010
file servers.

27
00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.470
It's going to be an installation of the
operating system where you don't sit down

28
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.140
in front of it and use graphical programs.

29
00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.970
Ubuntu Desktop, however, is for just that.

30
00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.910
So I will click Download Ubuntu,
and take the default 64-bit.

31
00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.250
I've already done this
to save us some time.

32
00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.840
So I'll just close
the web browser here and

33
00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.620
you can see that I've downloaded Ubuntu.

34
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.501
I'll go ahead and start VirtualBox.

35
00:03:08.224 --> 00:03:11.244
And create a new container or
virtual machine for

36
00:03:11.244 --> 00:03:14.050
our Ubuntu operating system installation.

37
00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.330
We can see here that is asks for
three bits of information.

38
00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.460
The Name, the Type and the Version.

39
00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:27.180
So, I'm going to name it ubuntudesktop.

40
00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.590
And then as I type that in there it
automatically selected Linux as the type

41
00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.360
and Ubuntu as the version.

42
00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.207
If it didn't you can simply
use the drop down boxes and

43
00:03:35.207 --> 00:03:37.050
select whatever is appropriate.

44
00:03:40.605 --> 00:03:45.300
The minimum amount of RAM
recommended is 512 megabytes.

45
00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:46.840
I have plenty to use here,

46
00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.400
so I'm gonna dedicate about half my
resources to this virtual machine.

47
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.185
So I'll use 4096 megabytes or
four gigabytes.

48
00:03:57.883 --> 00:04:00.010
Next, we need to create
a virtual hard drive.

49
00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.790
Click on Create, and
the default of VDI is fine.

50
00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.788
Especially if you're not going
to be using this disk image with

51
00:04:09.788 --> 00:04:11.439
other virtualization software.

52
00:04:14.862 --> 00:04:16.420
You have two choices here.

53
00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.990
One is dynamically allocated and
the other is fixed size.

54
00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:24.340
If your primary concern is
about preserving disk space or

55
00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.060
using as little disk space as possible,
choose Dynamically Allocated.

56
00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.520
However if you're looking for
performance use Fixed Size.

57
00:04:36.513 --> 00:04:37.840
That's a fine name.

58
00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.750
I will specify 100 gigabytes for
my hard drive,

59
00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.480
although eight gigabytes is
sufficient to install Ubuntu too.

60
00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.170
I like having some additional space.

61
00:04:51.471 --> 00:04:53.310
So now we have our virtual machine.

62
00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.080
Next, we need to install Ubuntu.

63
00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.680
Lets power on the virtual
machine to install Ubuntu.

64
00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:05.910
Click Start or you can even right-click
and click Start there, either one is fine.

65
00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.590
And now it will ask us for
the Ubuntu image that we downloaded.

66
00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:18.723
I'll select where I downloaded it
on my computer and click Start.

67
00:05:44.384 --> 00:05:45.795
We have two options here.

68
00:05:45.795 --> 00:05:49.955
One is Try Ubuntu and
the second one is Install Ubuntu.

69
00:05:49.955 --> 00:05:54.995
Try Ubuntu simply runs the operating
system in memory and lets you try it out.

70
00:05:54.995 --> 00:05:58.415
However, Install Ubuntu actually
writes to your hard disk.

71
00:05:58.415 --> 00:06:01.965
In this case it's going to write to the
virtual hard disk in the virtual machine,

72
00:06:01.965 --> 00:06:04.880
so we're not gonna lose any data,
for example,

73
00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.780
override our current operating system.

74
00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:08.880
So, that's what we're going to do here,
Install.

75
00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:13.520
I'm going to click Continue and
accept the defaults here, but

76
00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:18.390
you can install third party software that
allows you to play mp3's, for example.

77
00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:22.910
And you could also download any patches or
bug fixes or other updates for

78
00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:27.010
the Ubuntu operating system by clicking
Download updates while installing.

79
00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:29.811
I'll click Continue.

80
00:06:32.506 --> 00:06:34.820
And I'm going to just erase this disk.

81
00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:36.716
Again, it's a virtual disk
that we just created.

82
00:06:44.508 --> 00:06:47.080
And then you can click on the map for
your time zone.

83
00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.549
I'm just gonna leave it at Chicago.

84
00:06:53.476 --> 00:06:55.305
And you can choose your keyboard here.

85
00:07:06.469 --> 00:07:08.700
And just fill out your
account information.

86
00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:11.590
And click Continue.

87
00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.790
The installation will take
several minutes to complete.

88
00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:23.240
So I'm just going to fast
forward from this point on.

89
00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:28.760
Once the installation completes, your job
is done if you're running on physical

90
00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:32.850
hardware such as a desktop,
a laptop, or a server.

91
00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:34.780
However, since we're
using a virtual machine,

92
00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:37.030
we need to perform one additional step.

93
00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:40.990
And that additional step is to
install some software that helps

94
00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:44.760
Linux understand the virtual
hardware that it's working with.

95
00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:48.505
And that piece of software is called
Guest Additions in VirtualBox.

96
00:07:54.092 --> 00:07:58.190
Now that the installation is finished,
I'm going to power on the virtual machine.

97
00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:02.341
You can highlight it and click Start,
or right-click and click Start.

98
00:08:26.976 --> 00:08:31.547
Going to log in with a password
that I used during installation.

99
00:08:38.344 --> 00:08:41.274
And next, since this is a virtual machine,

100
00:08:41.274 --> 00:08:46.511
we need to insert the Guest Addition CD
image and install the Guest Additions.

101
00:08:54.506 --> 00:09:00.680
Then, we'll click Run And
it will ask for our password again.

102
00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:04.811
So we'll type that in and
click Authenticate.

103
00:09:08.539 --> 00:09:11.648
And we'll let
the VirtualBox Guest Additions install.

104
00:09:21.126 --> 00:09:22.250
Okay, that's complete.

105
00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:25.080
We'll just hit Return or press Enter.

106
00:09:26.552 --> 00:09:29.680
And then now I'm going to
restart this virtual machine,

107
00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:32.709
so we can use the Guest Additions.

108
00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:36.922
And I'll click Restart.

109
00:09:57.534 --> 00:10:00.094
Going to log in again with my account.

110
00:10:07.388 --> 00:10:09.030
And there that's so much better though.

111
00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:14.725
Graphics are filling up my display and
Ubuntu is installed.

112
00:10:14.725 --> 00:10:24.059
