00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.130
This process is outlined in
the supplemental material,

2
00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:05.050
that is attached to this video.

3
00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:10.267
The first thing we want to do is download
a Linux VDI, or virtual disk image.

4
00:00:11.887 --> 00:00:16.454
To do that, we'll go to
VirtualBoxImages.com, in this case,

5
00:00:16.454 --> 00:00:18.287
I'm looking for CentOS.

6
00:00:18.287 --> 00:00:24.269
I'm gonna find that in the right-hand
column, and I'm looking for desktop.

7
00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:32.031
There it is, now I'm just going
to click the download link, and

8
00:00:32.031 --> 00:00:33.710
let that start downloading.

9
00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.590
If you follow the document
that's attached to this video,

10
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.960
you won't have to search
around their website.

11
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.121
In order to download the image,
I've provided links to the page,

12
00:00:43.121 --> 00:00:45.278
and the direct download link for
you as well.

13
00:00:48.098 --> 00:00:51.736
While that one is downloading,
let's look for Ubuntu.

14
00:00:51.736 --> 00:00:56.470
You don't have to download both images,
you can just pick one and download it.

15
00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.370
You can look at the centOS page, and
see if that appeals to you in any way,

16
00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.160
if it does download that one,
if it doesn't try Ubuntu.

17
00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.426
The files that you download
are actually archives, so

18
00:01:07.426 --> 00:01:12.044
we'll need some sort of software to
extract the contents of those archives.

19
00:01:12.044 --> 00:01:16.405
For Windows, we'll use Free WinUnRAR,

20
00:01:16.405 --> 00:01:19.893
you can open up a web browser, and

21
00:01:19.893 --> 00:01:25.384
search in Google for F-W-I-N-U-N-R-A-R.

22
00:01:25.384 --> 00:01:29.164
We'll pull up the website, and
then download the installation file.

23
00:01:31.124 --> 00:01:35.230
To perform the installation,
open the file, and accept the defaults.

24
00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:37.990
In this case just click Install,
and then Close.

25
00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.456
Now you can find the archive that
you downloaded, right click on it,

26
00:01:44.456 --> 00:01:45.855
and click extract.

27
00:01:52.436 --> 00:01:55.396
And you can see that in this archive,
there were three files.

28
00:02:00.476 --> 00:02:03.550
For Mac users, we can use UnRarX,

29
00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:08.438
you can download that
from U-N-R-A-R-X dot com.

30
00:02:14.431 --> 00:02:18.419
Once it's downloaded, double-click
on the zip archive to extract it,

31
00:02:18.419 --> 00:02:21.069
and then drag that to
your applications folder.

32
00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:26.127
To extract the contents of the archive,

33
00:02:26.127 --> 00:02:28.979
just double-click on the file
that you downloaded.

34
00:02:43.768 --> 00:02:48.406
And you can see that in this archive,
there were three files from this point on,

35
00:02:48.406 --> 00:02:52.026
the process is the same whether
you're using Windows or Mac.

36
00:02:52.026 --> 00:02:58.290
Start VirtualBox, click New,

37
00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.660
give your virtual machine a name,
either centOS or Ubuntu.

38
00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.453
You can leave the RAM at the default,
if you have extra you can add some more.

39
00:03:10.413 --> 00:03:14.053
Choose use an existing
virtual hard drive file.

40
00:03:18.473 --> 00:03:22.953
Click the folder, and navigate to where
you extracted the virtual disk image.

41
00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:36.000
Click create, now click on the green
arrow to start your virtual machine.

42
00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.160
In this example, I'm using CentOS,
you can see that it boots up.

43
00:04:07.261 --> 00:04:12.227
At the login screen, I will use the
password that is in the documentation, and

44
00:04:12.227 --> 00:04:16.001
as of right now that username,
and password is adminuser.

45
00:04:31.618 --> 00:04:35.259
Now that we see it works, I'm just
going to close the web browser, and

46
00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:36.198
shut down the OS.

47
00:04:42.938 --> 00:04:46.659
Now you have your very own copy of Linux,
that you can use with this course.
