00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.610
The first thing we need to do is download a CentOS VDI, or virtual disk

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:17.250
image.  Open up a web browser and visit, LinuxTrainingAcademy.com/vdi.  Click

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.949
on the CentOS 7 VDI download link.  This is a rather large file so this will take

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.810
several minutes to download.
Once the download is completed, we need to extract

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.220
the contents of the archive.  First you're going to navigate to the folder where

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:37.079
you saved the download. This is typically your downloads folder.  I'm on a mac, so

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.210
I'm going to double click on the archive to extract its contents.  Remember

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.800
that this process was covered in an earlier video, one for Mac users and

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.660
another video for Windows users.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.079
Once the contents of the archive have been extracted,

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.980
we'll start the virtual box application.
Next, create a new container or virtual machine

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.360
for our CentOS operating system installation.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.960
You can see here that it asks you for a few bits of information.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.180
The name, the type, and

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.960
the version.
I'm going to name it centosdesktop.
As I typed that

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.850
in, virtualbox automatically selected Linux as the type and RedHat as the

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.900
version.
If it didn't, we could simply use the dropdown boxes and make the

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.100
appropriate selections.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.460
The minimum amount of ram recommended is 1024

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.080
MB or 1 GB.
I have plenty of RAM to use on my system, so I'm going to

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:02.400
dedicated about half of my resources to this virtual machine.  So, I'll use 8192

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.420
MB or 8 gigabytes.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.900
Choose "an existing virtual hard drive file"

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.920
Click the folder icon, and navigate to where you extracted the virtual

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.520
disk image.  This will probably be in your downloads

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:32.560
folder.  Click on open and then click create.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:44.460
Let's power on the virtual machine by clicking on the virtual machine

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:50.040
and then clicking on the start button at the top. You can also right-click and click start there,

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.320
either way is fine.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:10.560
Once CentOS is booted up you'll be presented with a login screen.

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:14.260
To log in as the adminuser, click on that username.  Now enter in the password,

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:20.410
which is also adminuser.

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.750
By the way, the username and password for the system will be supplied with

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.920
the disk image.  So if you happen to use different disk image, look for the

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:35.319
username and password combination that works with that particular image.

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.040
The first time you log in you'll be asked a couple of questions to complete the

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.790
setup for the account.

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.160
Now that we see everything works,

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.520
I'm going to shutdown the system by clicking

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:27.460
in the top right hand corner and clicking on the power button.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:40.540
Now you can use this Linux installation to complete this course and practice your Linux skills.
