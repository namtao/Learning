00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:08.050
This video is for Windows users only.  If you're using Mac, skip

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:10.150
ahead to the next video.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:19.480
Open up a web browser and visit VirtualBox.org.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.349
Next, find the link that takes you to the download page.

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:28.660
From here, select the file for your platform, which is Windows.  So we'll

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:34.600
click on the link next to Windows hosts.
Once the download is complete

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:40.180
is you can click the file to begin the installation process. The installation is

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:41.530
fairly easy.

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.280
We're simply going to accept all the defaults and answer yes to all the

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:52.240
questions. So here, I'll click next.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:01:01.660
If so, just click on install or yes.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.460
You might be prompted a few times during the install.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.140
At the end of the installation,

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.480
clicking on Finish will start virtualbox.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.560
To start virtualbox

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.600
in the future, you can click in the search

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.380
bar and type "VirtualBox"

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.100
or you can click on the

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.380
windows button, and navigate your way to the VirtualBox Application.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:51.070
"Oracle VM VirtualBox".

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.650
there

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.150
Finally you'll see the application
itself Oracle VM VirtualBox and that's

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.050
how you would start in the future.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:06.210
Next, let's install a program called
7-zip to do that will visit seven dash

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:12.720
zip . o RG. You should see a download link right on the home page.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.860
Some reason you don't you can always
click on downloads to go to the full

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.239
download page. Here I'm just going to
click the download link next to the

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:26.310
64-bit file will click that and make
sure that that downloads.

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.010
Next we'll click on it to start the
installation will click on yes here.

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:38.580
Again we're going to accept the defaults
just like we did with virtualbox. Now the

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.650
installation is complete and we can
click close. In an upcoming video you'll

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.420
be asked to download and extract the contents of a compressed archive file.

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.470
You'll do that with 7-zip.  Here's an

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.750
example.  I have a file I downloaded that ends in 7z. I've

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.590
navigated to that file using the file explorer. It's in my downloads directory

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:08.190
here now i will right click on the file
go to the 7-zip sub menu and then click

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:14.040
"Extract Here."  You'll see that a new folder appears and it has the

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.910
uncompressed version of the file in it. So i'm going to double-click in there

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.950
and now you can see that it has a file
there. Now you're ready to install Linux

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.780
in a virtual machine using virtualbox.
