00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:06.470
In today's lesson, you will learn
what Linux is, where Linux came from,

2
00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.970
what a Linux distribution is, and some
of the reasons that Linux is favored for

3
00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:14.439
certain applications and
projects over other operating systems.

4
00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:20.060
First and foremost,
Linux is an operating system.

5
00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.980
An operating system is simply a collection
of software that manages hardware

6
00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.100
resources and provides an environment
where applications can run.

7
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.030
The operating system allows
applications to store information,

8
00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:35.969
send documents to printers,
interact with users, and other things.

9
00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.010
Linux is also a kernel.

10
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.840
Typically, when the term Linux is used,

11
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.070
it refers to the Linux
operating system as a whole.

12
00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.960
However, it can refer to just
the Linux kernel as well.

13
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.650
The Linux kernel is the core or
the heart of the operating system.

14
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.535
It's the layer that sits between
the hardware and applications.

15
00:00:56.535 --> 00:01:00.960
Said another way, it's the intermediary
between software and hardware.

16
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.360
However, to have a useful operating
system you need other components

17
00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.230
in addition to the kernel.

18
00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.860
These components can include system
libraries, graphical user interfaces,

19
00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.230
email utilities, web browsers,
and other programs.

20
00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.490
Linus Torvalds created Linux when he was
a student at the University of Helsinki

21
00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.540
studying computer science.

22
00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.090
In early 1991, he purchased an IBM
compatible personal computer that came

23
00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.100
with a MS-DOS operating system.

24
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.640
Linus wasn't satisfied with MS-DOS, and

25
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.260
wanted to use a UNIX operating system like
he was accustomed to at the university.

26
00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.710
When he set out to obtain a copy
of UNIX for his personal use,

27
00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:45.110
he found that the least expensive
UNIX he could buy was about $5,000.

28
00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.260
Driven by the desire to run a UNIX-like
Operating System on his personal computer,

29
00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.380
he set out to create Linux.

30
00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.390
Linus and over 100 developers worked on
Linux over the next couple of years and

31
00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:01.080
in March of 1994, version 1.0 of
the Linux kernel was released.

32
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.720
Linux is open source software.

33
00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.480
This means that anyone can use, copy,
study, and change the software in

34
00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:13.290
any way they choose, so long as the source
code is openly shared with others.

35
00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.680
To date, thousands of people
have made improvements to Linux.

36
00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.030
And with Linux being free and

37
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.040
open source software, it has led to
the rise of Linux distributions.

38
00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.350
In every case the source code is free, but

39
00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.670
in some cases
the distribution is not free.

40
00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.170
The binaries,
the compiled code is not free.

41
00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.310
For example, you have to pay a license in
order to run Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

42
00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.850
However, Red Hat releases
their source code for

43
00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.100
anyone to download, again,
Linux is not a UNIX derivative.

44
00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.750
It was written from scratch,

45
00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.100
however many of the commands that
are found in Linux are also found on UNIX.

46
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.930
If you have any experience on a UNIX
system you're going to feel right at home

47
00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.320
on a Linux system.

48
00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.270
A Linux distribution is
the Linux kernel and

49
00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.580
a collection of software that
together create an operating system.

50
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.270
Each distribution has its own goals and
areas of focus.

51
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.190
Your choice of distribution will depend
on what you are trying to accomplish.

52
00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.550
There are distributions
that are commercial.

53
00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.190
These commercial Linux distributions
are backed by corporations, and

54
00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.358
you can buy support from them.

55
00:03:15.358 --> 00:03:18.350
There are non-commercial
Linux distributions,

56
00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.999
these are maintained by
a community of volunteers.

57
00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.630
You have Linux distributions
that are designed for

58
00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.250
server use, others that are designed for
desktop use.

59
00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.020
Some that are focused on research and

60
00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:34.370
science, there are others that
are focused on multimedia production.

61
00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.100
There are literally hundreds
of Linux distributions.

62
00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.800
distrowatch.com is a great website
to learn about all the available

63
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.530
Linux distributions,
distro is short for distribution.

64
00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.150
On your screen I've listed some
popular Linux distributions,

65
00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:55.140
Red Hat Enterprise Linux,
Fedora, Ubuntu, Debian,

66
00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.510
SuSE Linux Enterprise Server,
OpenSuSE, Linux Mint.

67
00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.250
Again, there are hundreds of these, these
are just a few of the most popular Linux

68
00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:11.130
distributions, to get an idea of exactly
what's available go to distrowatch.com.

69
00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.670
So what are some of the reasons
you would want to run Linux?

70
00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:19.600
Linux runs on many hardware platforms
from dedicated networking devices

71
00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.590
to phones to personal computers and
even super computers.

72
00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.320
Proprietary UNIX operating
systems typically

73
00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.298
only run on their hardware
from their company.

74
00:04:29.298 --> 00:04:36.620
For example, HP-UX only runs on HP
servers, AIX only runs on IBM servers.

75
00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:41.090
Linux can run on HP,
IBM and other servers.

76
00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.460
Linux was developed on PC
hardware using Intel processors.

77
00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.810
Over time Linux has been ported
to more hardware platforms than

78
00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:50.620
any other operating system.

79
00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.850
The small footprint of Linux,
allows it to run on older hardware or

80
00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:56.100
on embedded systems.

81
00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:01.960
Also, Linux is known for
being stable, reliable and secure.

82
00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.390
This makes it a great choice for

83
00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:06.710
servers that need to continuously
run without down time.

84
00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.060
Linux has traditionally been used for
server applications.

85
00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.930
Linux can be used to host websites,
act as file servers, and

86
00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.220
even run database software.

87
00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:20.070
Linux doesn't have to be used as a server
though, I find Linux to be a good

88
00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:24.030
every day operating system that
I use on my personal desktop.

89
00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:24.670
As a matter of fact,

90
00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:27.239
I'm recording this course with
software that is running on Linux.

91
00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:33.510
Linux is free, not only is the source code
freely available, but you can run Linux on

92
00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:37.650
your hardware without having to
pay a licensing fee in many cases.

93
00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:41.205
However, if your business depends
on servers that are running Linux,

94
00:05:41.205 --> 00:05:44.765
having a commercial Linux
distribution which you pay for, and

95
00:05:44.765 --> 00:05:48.295
having someone that can provide support,
can be well worth your while.

96
00:05:48.295 --> 00:05:52.706
Linux is typically not as costly as
the proprietary UNIX operating systems.

97
00:05:52.706 --> 00:05:56.957
Linux is also free in the sense that
you can use it for any purpose, and

98
00:05:56.957 --> 00:06:00.128
you can modify it to fit
your needs if you so desire.

99
00:06:00.128 --> 00:06:03.618
There are also many free software
applications that run on Linux,

100
00:06:03.618 --> 00:06:07.810
many of these free applications were
written specifically with Linux in mind.

101
00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.140
Let's recap what we've
gone over in this lesson.

102
00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:15.060
First, we learned that Linux
is an operating system.

103
00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:18.300
When someone says the word
Linux without a qualifier,

104
00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:22.020
more than likely they are talking
about the entire operating system.

105
00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.400
However, Linux is also a kernel.

106
00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.610
When people speak of the Linux kernel,
they are typically specific and

107
00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:29.610
say the Linux kernel.

108
00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:31.250
Linux, being the operating system,

109
00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:35.065
is the intermediary between hardware and
software.

110
00:06:35.065 --> 00:06:38.065
Linux distributions
are implementations of Linux.

111
00:06:38.065 --> 00:06:42.385
Each Linux distribution has a different
goal, and a slightly different focus.

112
00:06:42.385 --> 00:06:45.915
Your choice of distribution will be driven
by the goal you are trying to accomplish.
