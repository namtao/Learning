This video is for Mac users only.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.000
If you're using windows, skip ahead to the next video.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.880
The first thing we're going to do is
open up a web browser and visit virtual VirtualBox.org.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:22.920
Next, find the link that takes
you to the download page

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:29.740
From here, select the file for your platform which is max so well click on the link next to OS X hosts.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.880
Once the download is complete,
we'll go ahead and click on the file to open it.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.800
Now we can, double click on "VirtualBox.pkg" to start the installation.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.800
Click Continue.

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:00.560
continue and will click continue again
and now we'll click install

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.840
It prompts you for your password go ahead and enter
that.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.340
The installer reports that the
installation was successful so we can go

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.030
ahead and click on the close button. Now,
that the installation is complete.

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.310
You can start virtualbox by using spotlight. Press command-space or click the

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.140
magnifying glass icon in the upper right
hand corner of the menu bar to bring up

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.299
the spotlight search bar. From here,
simply type in virtualbox and press return.

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:38.180
You can also start virtualbox by
opening up the finder, navigating to the

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.640
applications folder and double-clicking
on VirtualBox there.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:48.640
Next, let's install The Unarchiver. The easiest way to do that is to open up the app store.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.210
Let's start spotlight again by clicking
on the magnifying glass icon in the

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.039
upper right hand corner of your screen
or again by pressing command space.

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:06.779
So, now just type in appstore and press
return. Next, what we want to do is search for the "the unarchiver".

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.460
That should bring up a list of matching applications.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.160
Now simply click on install under the on
archiver and enter enter your password

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.720
if you're prompted to do so. In an
upcoming video you'll be asked to

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:26.060
download and extract the contents of a
compressed archive file.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.780
You'll do that with The Unarchiver. Here's an example. I have a file I downloaded that ends in 7z.

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:39.140
I've navigated to that file using the
finder. Now I'll just double click the file and The Unarchiver

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.200
will extract the contents of that file. We navigate

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.340
into the folder that are created you can
see that the uncompressed file is in

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.360
that folder. Now you're ready to install
linux and a virtual machine using virtualbox.
