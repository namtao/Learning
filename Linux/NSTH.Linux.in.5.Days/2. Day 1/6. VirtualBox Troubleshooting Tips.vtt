00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.660
I want to go over some common issues

2
00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:06.490
that might arise when working with

3
00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:08.980
VirtualBox. The first issue I want to

4
00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.950
talk about is antivirus software. Some

5
00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:14.200
windows antivirus software such as

6
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.570
Avira, AVG and others have been known to

7
00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.189
interfere with the operation of

8
00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:20.710
virtualbox. I've listed some errors on

9
00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:22.240
your screen here that can be associated

10
00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.880
with this type of issue. If you get such

11
00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.830
an error when starting a virtual machine

12
00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.440
try disabling your antivirus software

13
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.539
and rebooting your system.

14
00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:33.910
Here's a screenshot of one such error.

15
00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.429
Again the workaround for this is to

16
00:00:36.429 --> 00:00:39.129
simply disable the antivirus software or

17
00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:41.379
switch to another antivirus software

18
00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:43.449
that doesn't interfere with virtualbox.

19
00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:45.879
If you happen to have a mac you could

20
00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:48.249
use it for your coursework as most of

21
00:00:48.249 --> 00:00:49.929
the issues will be talking about here

22
00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:54.039
are windows related in some way. If you

23
00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:55.719
see an error in your virtual machine

24
00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:57.699
window that says something along the

25
00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:01.089
lines of this kernel requires an x86 64

26
00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:04.780
cpu but only detected an i686 cpu

27
00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.460
then you need to enable the

28
00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.430
virtualization options in your bios. This

29
00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.280
means making sure that you have VT-x for

30
00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.970
Intel processors and AMD-v for AMD

31
00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.490
processors enabled. This varies from

32
00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.040
manufacturer to manufacturer so you

33
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.840
might have to look up the documentation

34
00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.880
for your specific computer.

35
00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.070
Another thing that can cause the this

36
00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.730
kernel requires an x86 64 cpu message

37
00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.970
can be that you've selected a 32-bit

38
00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.150
processor in virtual box itself. In this

39
00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:38.890
case the error message really isn't

40
00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.870
talking about your physical processor

41
00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.300
but the virtual processor that it sees.

42
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.550
Go into the settings of the virtual

43
00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.710
machine you're having an issue with and

44
00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.620
make sure you selected a 64-bit version

45
00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.930
for whatever linux distribution you're

46
00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.510
using. For example, if you're using CentOS

47
00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.750
select red hat 64-bit because centos

48
00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.090
really is red hat just without the

49
00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.159
branding. If you are using Ubuntu make

50
00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:05.890
sure you select Ubuntu 64-bit, etc.

51
00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.600
Finally, I want to leave you with one

52
00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.550
last troubleshooting step which is to

53
00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.799
simply reboot your physical computer and

54
00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:12.730
try again.

55
00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.530
There's a chance that something is not

56
00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.420
functioning properly that isn't

57
00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.000
immediately obvious to us. When it comes

58
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.739
to troubleshooting our local systems

59
00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.659
this is a relatively quick and harmless

60
00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:28.440
thing to try.
