00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.700
At this point you should have virtual
box installed for your operating system.

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.320
The next thing we're going to do is download CentOS from centos.org.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.360
We'll click on "get centos now" or whatever the link to the download section

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.560
of the website happens to be at the time you watch this video.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.340
You'll notice you have a few options here.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.300
The DVD ISO is perfect for what we're about to do.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.480
This DVD image contains all the packages that can be installed using the installer.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.240
So we're going to click on "DVD ISO" to download it.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.460
The previous page and let's talk about
the everything ISO and the minimal ISO.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.800
So the everything I so contains the
complete set of packages for CentOS.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.090
You would use this image if you wanted to create a local mirror of CentOS packages.

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.230
For example

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.910
Finally, the Minimal ISO will allow you to install a very basic CentOS system.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.680
If you use this image it won't install a graphical user environment.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.180
If you wanted a graphical user environment, and almost any other type of software,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:21.000
you would have to install it manually after the initial OS install.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.840
So again, the best choice for us is the DVD ISO.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.540
Once we have our ISO Downloaded, we're ready to create a virtual machine.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.160
Go ahead and start the virtualbox application.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.660
Create a new container or virtual machine for our CentOS operating system installation.

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.670
You can see here that it asks you for a few bits of information.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.550
I'm going to name it centosdesktop.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:02:00.160
As I typed that in, virtualbox automatically selected Linux as the type and RedHat as the version.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.689
When we're doing a CentOS installation
now remember that Santos is a red hat.

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:08.042
linux derivative so that's the version.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.660
We're going to tell virtualbox that were
using virtualbox didn't automatically select the type

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.380
or version for you you can simply
click on it and select the type from the

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:22.840
list which again is linux or the version
here which is red hat 64-bit

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.860
going to go ahead and click continue and go to the
next step. Here it's saying the

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.730
recommended memory sizes a thousand
twenty four megabytes which is one

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.430
gigabyte. You can see that in my system
here i have 16384 megabytes or 16

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.450
gigabytes about, so I'm going to
dedicate about half my resources to this virtual machine.

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.450
So, I'll use 8192 MB or 8 gigabytes.

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.860
maybe you could devote to gig to your
virtual machine etcera. So i'll click

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:55.720
continue to continue and what we need to
do now is create a hard disk of virtual

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.610
hard disk for this system.

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.410
Go ahead and click create at this step
you want to choose the hard disk type

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.600
we're going to leave it at the default
of vdi a virtualbox disk image. At this

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.790
point we have two choices one is
dynamically allocated and the other is

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.860
fixed size. Primary concern is
about preserving this space or using as

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.140
little disk space as possible, choose Dynamically allocated.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.920
However, if you're looking for better performance, use Fixed Size.

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.420
I'm going to go ahead and
use dynamically allocated press continue here.

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:37.209
Now we need to specify a size
for our disc i'm going to specify 100

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:39.489
gigabytes for my hard drive,

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:43.900
although 8 gigabytes is sufficient to
install CentOS to. I like having some

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.670
additional space so that's why I'm going
with a larger size. So we'll click create

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.659
so now we have our virtual machine.

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:58.159
Next, we need to install CentOS. Let's
power on the virtual machine to do that

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.439
you can either click start at the top or
right click and press start. Like I'm

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.460
going to do I'll do a normal start.

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:15.160
Now it's going to ask us for a disk image to boot this system from and what you want
to do is click on the folder icon and

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:20.180
navigate to the location that you
downloaded the ISO from centos dot org.

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:31.700
So i'll click on that and click here
click open and now we'll hit start to boot the system.

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.220
You'll notice that you
have a couple of options.

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:44.419
The "Check media and install CentOS" is highlight. What
this will do is make sure that the image

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:48.710
you are using isn't corrupted. The ISO
image that you downloaded from centos.

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.739
I recommend going with the default
here so press ENTER to start the

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.900
installation. I'll click inside the
virtual machine and then press enter.

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:03.000
You'll see that the system starts to
boot and then it starts checking the media.

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.830
The ISO image that were using
to do the installation.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:14.419
Here is the first install screen. There's
a button at the bottom of this

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:18.650
installation screen that I can't even
see. I want to make sure that I see

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:23.150
everything that centos is showing me, so
I'm going to put this virtual machine

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:28.250
into scale mode. What this will do is fit
the virtual machine screen inside my

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:33.020
virtualbox window. So I can make the
window as small or as large as I want,

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:38.000
and I can still see the entire screen of
the virtual machine. Since we've already

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.409
clicked inside the virtual machine
window, the virtual machine has control

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:46.610
over the mouse and keyboard. So anything
that I type, or any mouse movements that

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:51.110
I make are going to the virtual machine.
To get control back to the whole system,

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:56.090
we need to press the host key which is a
special key reserved for Virtualbox actions.

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:02.000
By default the host key is the
left Command Key on a Mac, on Windows it's the right control key.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.710
Even if it's something different, you can always tell

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:11.479
what the host key is by looking in the
bottom right of your VM window. I'm on a

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:15.710
Mac and so you can see that Left
followed by the Command symbol is

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:20.090
displayed in the bottom right of the VM
window. When I press that designated

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:23.719
host key, the control of the mouse and
keyboard are returned to the host computer.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:30.169
Now I can go to the view menu and select on Scaled Mode.

00:06:32.729 --> 00:06:40.009
On a Windows system you'll go to the View menu that is in the menu bar at the top of your VM window and select Scaled Mode.

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:44.420
VirtualBox will tell you how to get out of this scaled mode if you want to.

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:49.810
It says press Host+C and it tells you what the host key is set to.

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:55.920
I'm going to go ahead and click on
switch to switch to scale mode.

00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:01.020
Now I can see the entire screen of the virtual machine in my window so now i'm just

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:05.840
going to increase the size of the window
so I can really see what's going on inside the virtual machine.

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.760
At this point
i'll click in the virtual machine and

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:21.660
now the virtual machine has control of
my mouse and keyboard so now i'm just

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:26.939
going to mouse over the continue button
and click to start the installation.

00:07:26.939 --> 00:07:31.379
On this installation summary screen we can go through each item if we want and make

00:07:31.379 --> 00:07:36.180
some changes for example the date and
time is set to America's new york for me

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:39.930
if you want to change this you would
simply click on that and then select

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:43.969
your place in the world and then click
done. So i'm just going to leave it as

00:07:43.979 --> 00:07:47.879
America's new york and i'll click done
and again the same thing with the

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:51.689
keyboard and the language support. The
one thing that we really need to change

00:07:51.689 --> 00:07:56.099
is the software selection so make sure
to click on this so what we want is a

00:07:56.100 --> 00:08:02.249
graphical user environment, so let's
click on a gnome desktop here and then

00:08:02.249 --> 00:08:05.870
there are some add-ons to the right
these are optional. However, there is one

00:08:05.879 --> 00:08:09.749
that I want you to click because we're
going to be using some of the software

00:08:09.749 --> 00:08:13.722
that gets included. There in just a few
minutes, so head on over to the right

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:18.659
side of the screen and make sure that
the development tools are check. So when

00:08:18.659 --> 00:08:23.399
we've done that we'll just go up here
and click done and then the installation

00:08:23.399 --> 00:08:28.740
destination. Will click on that and then
you can see that it automatically

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:34.169
selects our virtual hard disk. So when
we're doing this installation it may say

00:08:34.169 --> 00:08:37.289
that we're going to overwrite everything.
On the hard disk well it's going to

00:08:37.289 --> 00:08:42.140
overwrite everything on the virtual hard
disk and that is just fine, so everything

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:47.360
looks good on the screen.There's nothing
to change you just need to go in here firm, so we'll click done.

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:54.160
So now it gives us the option to begin installation and

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:57.160
that's what we're going to do will click
that button.

00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:01.900
On the screen you can do two things here
the first thing is set a root password

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:06.400
which will go ahead and do will click on
that and then you're going to set a

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:10.360
password for the root account and we'll
be talking about the root account later

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:15.420
in this course. So just go ahead and pick
a password and be sure to remember that password.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.960
Then we'll click on done,
now if you choose a weak password it

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:28.570
will make you press done twice to
confirm that you're going with a less

00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:34.540
secure password. So in any case will
click done, so now we have the option of

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:38.650
creating a user and we want to go ahead
and do that as well so we'll just mouse

00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:44.820
over to the right there and click on
user creation. So here is where you'll

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:49.170
enter your information for your personal
account on this system, so i'm going to

00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:56.560
enter my name and you want to make sure
that you check this box is make this

00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:00.910
user administrator checking, that box
will make it easier for you to do things

00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:05.500
on the system such as install software
and do other kind of administrative

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:10.270
tasks like that will be covering that
later in this course as well. So now we

00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:17.590
need to supply a password. Then
that's all we need to do on this screen.

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:23.600
Will click done and then we'll just wait
for centos to perform its installation.

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:28.220
Now that the main installation is done
we need to go ahead and reboot the

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:32.560
system and finish up the installation. So
go ahead and click on the reboot button now.

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:47.740
When the system first boots you may need
to accept the license information. So

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:53.530
right here we just hit one and press
enter and now will enter 2 to accept the

00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:59.410
license agreement. Now we just press
C to continue and then now that the

00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:05.830
license information has been accepted
will see an x + 7 ! there beside number

00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:09.880
one license information. So we're
done with this so we can have C to

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:15.940
continue and complete our first boot
into centos. Now that the system is

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:22.090
booted up i'm going to go ahead and
login as myself here.

00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:26.050
When you first login, will ask you to confirm your language I'm English so that's already

00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:30.460
selected and i'll click next, here we'll
also ask you about your keyboard layout

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:35.290
and English US is checked and that's
what i'm using some and click next and

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:39.610
now we're all set the installation is
complete. So i'll just click start using

00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:44.440
centos now. Now this getting started
screen is displayed and so you can take

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:47.500
some time and read through some of the
documentation and watch some of the

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:52.450
videos for example and so at this point
the installation is really complete. So

00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:56.320
our job would be done right here if
we're running on physical hardware such

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:59.440
as a desktop a laptop or server.

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:03.100
However, since we're using a virtual
machine we need to perform one

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:07.300
additional step. That additional step is
to install some software that helps

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:11.830
linux understand. The virtual hardware
that it's working with and that piece of

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:17.050
software is called virtualbox guest
additions. Now what we need to do is

00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:22.290
insert the guest additions CD image and
install those guest additions. So i'm

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:27.490
going to press the host key to get
control of the keyboard and mouse and

00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:32.190
now i'm going to go to the devices menu
and click insert guest additions CD image.

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:37.150
You'll see a pop-up that ask you
if you'd like to run the software that's

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:41.140
on this image and we do so i'm going to
click inside the virtual machine here to

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:44.580
get the mouse control back to the
virtual machine. I'm going to hover over

00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:47.920
run and click it.

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:52.240
Now we need to enter our password for
the account since we have administrative

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:56.800
privileges that we specified during the
installation. We can do things as such as

00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:00.550
install software which is what we're
doing out so i'll just go ahead and

00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:07.560
enter in my password. Click on
authenticate and now the guest additions

00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:12.250
will be installed guest additions
requires that the development tools were

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:15.730
installed and if you remember when we
selected the software for the

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:21.000
installation. We check the checkbox
beside development tools so if you have

00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:24.339
problem installing the guest additions
you need to make sure that, that was

00:13:24.339 --> 00:13:28.000
checked during your installation. So now
that the installation is done we can

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.980
press return to close the window, so i'm
going to go ahead and X out of the

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:36.910
getting started and i'm actually going
to reboot the virtual machine to show

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:41.250
you what happens when you have guest
additions install. So I click on the

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:46.120
right part of the screen at the power
button here and i'll just do a restart.

00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:55.860
Go ahead and again, so i'm

00:13:55.860 --> 00:14:00.020
going to press the host
key again to get control of the mouse

00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:04.430
and i'm going to go to the menu here and
then I'm going to click view and take us

00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:09.510
out of scale mode. So I'm just going to
hit scale mode there and then the screen

00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:13.670
will snap to a smaller size and so
what's interesting now is the resolution

00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:19.330
is better. So now I can take the screen
and drag it to how whatever size I want

00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:25.400
and now the graphics and the desktop.
Look a lot better than they did on the

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:30.200
first insulation and in that scale mode.
So one of the things that the virtualbox

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:34.790
guest additions does is provide a better
display experience for you.

00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:38.090
Okay that wraps up the manual
installation of centos
