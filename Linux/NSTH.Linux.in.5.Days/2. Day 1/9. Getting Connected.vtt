1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.620
In this lesson, you're going to learn how
to log into a Linux system, and we'll

2
00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.610
talk a little bit about SSH, what that is,
and what SSH clients you need to use.

3
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:15.210
If you have Linux installed on hardware
that you have physical access to, or

4
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.410
you have Linux installed in virtual
hardware, like a virtual machine

5
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.080
running in VirtualBox, then you can
connect directly to the Linux server.

6
00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.310
In this example, we'll be looking at
Linux running in a virtual machine.

7
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.680
In VirtualBox you can highlight
your Linux virtual machine and

8
00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.300
click the green button to start it up.

9
00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:38.830
We'll give it a few seconds here to boot.

10
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.330
Each Linux login screen
will be a little different.

11
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.710
In this case, you're given
a list of users to choose from.

12
00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.280
And when you click on that user, you can
enter in the password for that user and

13
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.490
click the log in button.

14
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.990
I'm going to select Jason,
type my password.

15
00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.710
I could either hit Enter here or
click on the Log In button.

16
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.190
That's all there is to it.

17
00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.090
Just enter your user name and password.

18
00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.950
In this example, your given a graphical
user interface, the Linux desktop.

19
00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.910
In order to interact
with the command line,

20
00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.340
you need to start the terminal
emulator application.

21
00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.050
In CentOS, this is located in the
Applications and then Systems Tools menu.

22
00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:39.440
There you see Terminal.

23
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.030
Just click on it.

24
00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.456
And the next lesson will start
interacting with the command line.

25
00:01:43.456 --> 00:01:46.790
For now, you just need to know where
the terminal application is so

26
00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.650
you can start it, and
to exit it you simply type Exit.

27
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.870
To log out of CentOS,
go to the System menu and Log Out.

28
00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.550
On some Linux systems,
you'll be prompted for a username.

29
00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.980
In this case,
you have to type in your username.

30
00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.040
I'm going to log in as Jason, so

31
00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:13.330
I'll type Jason and I can either
hit Log In or hit the Enter button.

32
00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:14.970
Then I'll type in my password.

33
00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.920
Let's see what it's like to log
into an Ubuntu Linux system.

34
00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.207
We'll highlight the Virtual Machine, and

35
00:02:24.207 --> 00:02:28.550
instead of clicking the green arrow this
time we can right-click and click Start.

36
00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.320
Sometimes these are configured
to auto login so

37
00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.510
you may not even have to enter
a user name and password in.

38
00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.590
You'll just be given the desktop.

39
00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.269
In this case you see a menu, again with
a list of users that you can select and

40
00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:52.690
then enter the password for that user.

41
00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:53.890
Hit Enter to login.

42
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.740
I'm going to select
the VirtualBoxImages.com user, and

43
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:04.340
that username is actually adminuser,
and the password is adminuser.

44
00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.350
What is displayed in the menu is
the description of the account.

45
00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:12.510
You can see that the Ubuntu
desktop is different than CentOS.

46
00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.582
Again, each Linux distribution is
gonna look slightly different and

47
00:03:16.582 --> 00:03:18.010
function slightly differently.

48
00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.380
Gonna exit out of the web browser here.

49
00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.220
You see a list of applications on
the left hand side of your screen.

50
00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.860
You can click on one of those to start it.

51
00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.510
If you don't find what you're looking for,

52
00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.150
you can click on the button in the top
left, and type in a search term.

53
00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.610
In this case we're looking for
the terminal application, so

54
00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.390
type in terminal and
click on the terminal.

55
00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:48.670
And there we are at the command line.

56
00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:56.320
And again, to exit the terminal
application just type in the word exit.

57
00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.630
I this desktop environment, to log out or

58
00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:05.380
shut down, go to the top right hand
corner and click the gear icon.

59
00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:10.170
I'm going to choose Shut Down, and when
prompted I'll click on Shut Down again.

60
00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:23.693
Sometimes you'll be presented with a text
prompt to log in instead of a graphical

61
00:04:23.693 --> 00:04:25.210
user interface.

62
00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.550
Again, just type in your username and
password.

63
00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:32.600
If you installed a server distribution
instead of a desktop distribution,

64
00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.050
this is the type of log in prompt
that you would expect to see.

65
00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.025
Again to exit, just type the word exit.

66
00:04:39.025 --> 00:04:43.050
I'll log in as the adminuser,
with the password of adminuser.

67
00:04:47.137 --> 00:04:50.687
If you are going to connect to
a Linux system over the network,

68
00:04:50.687 --> 00:04:53.090
more than likely you are going to use SSH.

69
00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:57.930
SSH stands for Secure Shell.

70
00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.305
SSH is a network protocol.

71
00:05:00.305 --> 00:05:03.020
Its primary purpose is
to allow you to connect

72
00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.250
from one system to another
system securely over a network.

73
00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.420
In the past, you would use Telnet.

74
00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:13.780
SSH has replaced Telnet as
its more secure counterpart.

75
00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.830
Telnet is practically obsolete today, but

76
00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.010
you may encounter it if you have
to connect to a legacy system.

77
00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.050
We've already touched on terminal
emulators a couple of times in this

78
00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:25.760
course already.

79
00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:28.660
In order to connect to
Linux over the network,

80
00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:32.780
we're going to need a terminal emulator
that also acts as an SSH client.

81
00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.800
For Windows,
the most popular SSH client and

82
00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.050
terminal emulator is
a program called PuTTY.

83
00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:44.968
To get PuTTY, you can open up a web
browser and type in P-U-T-T-Y.

84
00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:52.010
The first result in Google
is the download page.

85
00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:55.670
And you only need PUTTY.exe at this point.

86
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:04.800
I'm going to save the file.

87
00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:11.125
Now I'm going to open the file and
run the program In the host name or

88
00:06:11.125 --> 00:06:16.240
IP address box, I'm going to type in
the network name of my Linux server.

89
00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:21.410
In this example,
I'm using L-I-N-U-X-S-V-R.

90
00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:24.490
Whoever created your account on the Linux
server will be able to give you

91
00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:29.500
the details of either the host name or
the IP address to use.

92
00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:31.600
This could be a server at work.

93
00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.720
It could be a shared host account.

94
00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:41.140
So maybe you're SSHing into your
bluehost.com or hostgator.com SSH account.

95
00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:45.070
Leave the default port at 22
unless you are specifically given

96
00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:46.110
another port to use.

97
00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:49.300
Click Open to start the connection.

98
00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:53.550
The first time you connect to a server,
you'll get a security alert.

99
00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:55.700
And you can simply just click yes on this.

100
00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:59.740
This will only happen the first
time you log in to a server.

101
00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:04.920
Now you can enter your username and
password to log in.

102
00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:13.760
Type exit when you are done.

103
00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.200
PuTTY has many features and options.

104
00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:21.160
One of the things you can do is
specify your username in PuTTY

105
00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:22.950
before you try to connect.

106
00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:27.630
On the right hand side, click on Data and
then fill in the auto Log in field.

107
00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:36.293
I'm going to save this as a session so

108
00:07:36.293 --> 00:07:39.120
that I can quickly log in to
this server again in the future.

109
00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:42.680
I'll give it a name and
click the Save button.

110
00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:47.810
Then when I double-click it,
it will start a connection to that server.

111
00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:53.020
You'll see that PuTTY has already provided
the Linux server our username, and

112
00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:55.460
now all we have to do
is enter our password.

113
00:07:57.230 --> 00:08:02.210
I'm going to highlight my saved session,
click Load, and change the font.

114
00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:06.320
Go to the left hand side.

115
00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:09.580
Click on Appearance under Window.

116
00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:11.220
And then I'll change the font.

117
00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:14.630
Make it nice and large so we can see.

118
00:08:22.095 --> 00:08:26.355
You may have been given a IP address for
your server.

119
00:08:26.355 --> 00:08:29.835
So if you don't have a name, but
an IP, you can use that as well.

120
00:08:31.615 --> 00:08:35.215
Again, the first time you log in to
a server or particular IP address,

121
00:08:35.215 --> 00:08:38.465
it will ask you to confirm the postkey.

122
00:08:38.465 --> 00:08:39.275
Just click yes.

123
00:08:41.055 --> 00:08:44.796
Again, PuTTY knows our username
because we've specified it, and

124
00:08:44.796 --> 00:08:46.840
now we simply enter in our password.

125
00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:56.894
In order to connect to
a Linux system from Mac,

126
00:08:56.894 --> 00:09:00.050
you need to start
the terminal application.

127
00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:04.060
This is located in
the Applications folder, and

128
00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:06.780
there's a sub-folder in
there called Utilities.

129
00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:09.630
You'll find terminal.app
in that directory.

130
00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:12.940
Once the terminal application has started,

131
00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:15.650
you can use the SSH command
to initiate a connection.

132
00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:21.390
Commands are case sensitive, so
be sure to use lower case SSH.

133
00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:28.480
In this example, my username on
my Mac desktop is Jason, and

134
00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.480
on the Linux server it is also Jason.

135
00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:33.930
So I'm just going to type ssh linuxsvr.

136
00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:38.870
Again, just like in Windows you'll
be prompted about the host key.

137
00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:42.310
And you only have to accept this
the first time you connect.

138
00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:43.620
So, I'll type in yes.

139
00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:47.965
And then I'll be connected
to the Linux host.

140
00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:53.550
To exit, type exit.

141
00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:59.681
If you want to or need to connect to the
remote system using a different user name,

142
00:09:59.681 --> 00:10:03.827
you type in ssh space,
that user name, the @ symbol,

143
00:10:03.827 --> 00:10:07.820
which is Shift 2, and
the name of the Linux server.

144
00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:13.590
In this case I'm going to user adminuser,
and adminuser is the password.

145
00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:21.970
Now we're logged into the Linux system and
I'll type exit to get back.

146
00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:25.590
If you are using Linux at work,
you might connect to a server

147
00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:30.080
that ends in .yourcompanyname.com.

148
00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:34.260
Again, just use the host name or
IP address that you were given to use.

149
00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:37.830
You'll see that connecting to
an IP address works as well.

150
00:10:50.429 --> 00:10:54.115
To recap, if you have physical
access to a Linux system, or

151
00:10:54.115 --> 00:10:58.614
if that Linux system is running in
a virtual machine, as in VirtualBox,

152
00:10:58.614 --> 00:11:01.390
then you can log into it directly.

153
00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:05.240
Sometimes you'll be presented with
a graphical interface to log into.

154
00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:07.500
Sometimes it'll be just a textual prompt.

155
00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:11.850
If you're going to log in to
a Linux system over the network,

156
00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:13.290
you're going to use SSH.

157
00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:19.190
For Windows users, I recommend
using PuTTY as your SSH client.

158
00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:27.070
For Mac users, use the built-in terminal
application and a command line SSH client.
