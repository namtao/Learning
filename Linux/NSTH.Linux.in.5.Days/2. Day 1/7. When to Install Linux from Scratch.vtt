00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
The next video demonstrates another

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.890
method for installing linux. If you

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.599
already have linux installed using the

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.210
virtual disk image with virtualbox then

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.000
you can skip the next video. The method

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.320
you'll learn in the next video can be

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.660
used to install linux directly on

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.330
physical hardware or it can be used to

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.769
install linux with another

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.590
virtualization system such as VMware,

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.429
Hyper-V, Parallels Desktop for mac, KVM

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.160
and others. You'll also want to use that

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.140
method if you want to customize your

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.360
install. For example if your first

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.460
language isn't English, you may want to

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.680
add additional language support for your

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.780
native language. Perhaps you want to

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.489
install some additional software or

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.250
maybe you want a really minimal install

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.559
and don't want to install a lot of

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.809
software. Many of these things can be

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.430
changed after the initial installation

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.860
but sometimes it can be easier to start

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.899
out with a system exactly the way you

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.270
like it than it is to modify an existing

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.449
system. Again, if you already have linux

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.670
installed and running in VirtualBox you

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.530
can either watch the next video to see

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.750
what a manual installation looks like or

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.790
you can skip it all together. Either

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.200
choice is fine.
