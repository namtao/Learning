00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.080
In this lesson you're going to learn what a Linux distribution is, what the

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.580
most common Linux distributions are, and how to choose the right one for you.

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.529
Generally when someone uses the term Linux, they're referring to the Linux

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.670
operating system as a whole.
An Operating System is a collection of

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.690
software that manages hardware resources and provides an environment where

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:29.010
applications run. The Operating System allows applications to store information,

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.410
send documents to a printer, and interact with users, for example. A Linux

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.850
distribution is simply a collection of software and applications bundled

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.069
together and distributed as a single operating system.  For example, one Linux

00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:47.729
distribution might come with one particular web browser installed while

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:51.359
another Linux distribution will come with another web browser installed by

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:55.829
default.  You'll be able to browse the web on either distribution, but the specific

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.039
piece of software used to do that might be different.

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.549
It's important to point out here that the software that comes installed by

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:06.690
default can be changed.  If you don't like the web browser that shipped with the Linux

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.980
distribution you're using, you can install another one and use that.  You

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.970
can think of a Linux distribution as a curated collection of software that

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.630
works well together, but you're more than free to use the software and

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.940
applications that you like best.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.630
Before we continue, I'd like to point out that you'll often hear the term

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.430
Distribution shortened to distro.  Also, some people refer to the various

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.590
distributions as flavors. What every Linux distribution has in common,

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.690
though, is the Linux kernel.  Again, typically when the term Linux is used it refers to the

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.240
Linux Operating System as a whole.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.220
However, it can refer to just the Linux Kernel as well. The Linux kernel is the

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.360
core or the heart of the Operating System.  It’s the layer that sits between

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.830
the hardware and applications.  Said another way, it’s the intermediary

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.260
between software and hardware.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.159
However, to have a useful operating system you need other components in

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.840
addition to the kernel.  These components can include system libraries, graphical

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.870
user interfaces, email utilities, web browsers, and other programs. To summarize

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.030
a Linux distribution is the Linux kernel

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.890
and a collection of software that, together, create an operating system. By far,

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.700
the two most popular Linux distributions used in information technology

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:31.120
departments and by Linux professionals are RedHat Enterprise Linux and Ubuntu. So,

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.870
if you plan to use Linux in your current or future career as a Linux system

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.850
administrator, Linux system engineer, or even a database administrator or

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.290
software developer, then I highly recommend focusing on these two Linux

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.640
distributions.  You can forget about the literally hundreds and hundreds of Linux

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:54.010
distributions and choose between RedHat Enterprise Linux and Ubuntu. If you want to

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.300
work for large, traditional organizations like financial institutions,

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.980
transportation companies, telecommunication corporations, large

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.050
retailers, and healthcare organizations then you should choose RedHat. By the

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.230
way, to run RedHat you need to pay for a license.

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.530
However, there is really no need to pay for a license if you're going to be

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.569
running Linux at home or want something to practice on.  Instead use CentOS which

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:23.560
is a RedHat Enterprise Linux derivative that's completely free.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.880
It's really RedHat with the branding and logos replaced with CentOS branding.

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.350
If, on the other hand, you want to work for a startup or smaller, more nimble

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.739
web-based companies like Software-As-A-Service type businesses,

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:40.660
social networking sites, smaller ecommerce stores, or practically any

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.140
company the relies heavily on cloud computing, then Ubuntu is the

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.400
distribution for you. If you're using Linux strictly for fun, for personal

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.910
projects, or just want to see what other distributions have to offer,

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:57.850
feel free to try out some other popular distros like:  Linux Mint, Debian, Mageia,

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:04.780
Fedora, openSuse - (open-su-za), Arch Linux &amp; Slackware. When choosing a Linux distro for

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.890
personal use it mainly comes down to personal preference and if you like most

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.549
of the software that comes installed by default.  Of course, don't forget

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:16.450
CentOS and Ubuntu.  They make great distros for personal use as well.

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:22.539
Ultimately,  Linux is Linux at the core. No matter which choice you make, the Linux

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:26.440
concepts are going to be the same.  Sure, each distribution is going to be a

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.289
little different, but if you can do something on one

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:33.580
distribution you'll most likely be able to figure out how to do it on another. What

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.779
this really means is that you can't make a "wrong" decision.  Know that by simply

00:04:37.779 --> 00:04:41.409
choosing a Linux distribution -- any distribution -- you've already made the

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:46.089
right choice. To recap,a Linux distribution is the Linux kernel and a

00:04:46.089 --> 00:04:50.860
collection of software that, together, create an operating system. The two most

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.849
popular Linux distributions used in the industry today are RedHat Enterprise

00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:59.740
Linux and Ubuntu. If you want to gain RedHat experience without paying a

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.089
licensing fee, then use CentOS as it's really RedHat with the branding and logos

00:05:04.089 --> 00:05:06.039
replaced with CentOS branding.
