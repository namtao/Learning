00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.820
If you're trying to
access a virtual machine

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:07.380
that is running on your system,

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.880
the easiest way is to simply
start up the virtual machine

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.120
and interact with its VirtualBox.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.520
For this course, there really is no need to

00:00:15.546 --> 00:00:18.140
connect to the virtual
machine over the network.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:23.260
I really recommend just typing into the
virtual machine directly for this course.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.540
Here's an example.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.400
I've went ahead and started VirtualBox
on my local machine or my host system,

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.520
and I have a virtual box that is running.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.380
I'm simply going to open this virtual box

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.080
and you can see that it's in a window,
in a virtual box window.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.600
You can see the menu options
from VirtualBox itself.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.480
So what I'm going to do is
simply click into this virtual machine

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.000
and then interact with it

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.620
as if it were a real physical Linux machine

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.150
that I'm sitting in front of.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.840
You know, I can do things like
start a terminal

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.070
or start a web browser and I can,
you know, just type right into the system.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.340
And that's really how I recommend you
go through this course.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.060
However if you want to connect
to the virtual machine

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.640
that is running on your computer
over the network,

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.560
see the lesson on this topic
toward the end of the course.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.960
I created that lesson specifically
for the few students

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.340
who asked to learn more about that topic.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.420
I placed it at the end of the course

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.600
because it requires
the use of some techniques

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.400
that are not covered until later.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.320
Again, that lesson is totally optional

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.500
and I recommend that
you proceed with this course

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.640
and only watch that lesson if you're
specifically interested in that topic

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.660
and that you watch that lesson

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.220
only after you've seen
all the other lessons in this course.
