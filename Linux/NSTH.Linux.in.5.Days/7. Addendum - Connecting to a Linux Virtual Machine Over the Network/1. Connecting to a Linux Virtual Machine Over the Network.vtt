00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.500
The purpose of this lecture is to answer

2
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.350
some questions about connecting

3
00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.300
to a Linux system over a network.

4
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.420
Specifically, this lesson will cover

5
00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.420
connecting to a virtual machine
over a network.

6
00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.750
If you are using a virtual machine where

7
00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.000
you are connecting directly to it or

8
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.500
if you have physical access to a Linux system

9
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.500
or you are able to connect to your

10
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.500
Linux system over the network successfully,

11
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.180
feel free to skip this lesson.

12
00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.500
In this lesson you'll learn all the

13
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.500
steps involved in connecting to

14
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.550
a virtual machine that is running
Linux over the network.

15
00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.500
We'll talk about the settings needed

16
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.750
in Virtual Box in order to allow for
network connections.

17
00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.550
You'll also learn how to check if

18
00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.600
the Linux system is ready to accept

19
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.450
network connections and if not,

20
00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.150
how to prepare it for those network connections.

21
00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:51.750
If you're trying to access a

22
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.500
virtual machine that is running

23
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.500
on your system, the easiest way is to

24
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.500
simply start up the virtual machine

25
00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.000
and interact with it through VirtualBox.

26
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.100
For this course, there really is no need

27
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.250
to connect to the virtual machine over

28
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.450
the network. I really recommend just

29
00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.500
typing into the virtual machine

30
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.400
directly for this course.

31
00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.750
Here's an example. I've went ahead

32
00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.000
and started VirtualBox on my local

33
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.400
machine or my 'host' system and I have

34
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.200
a VirtualBox that is running.

35
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.600
I'm simply going to open this VirtualBox

36
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.600
and you can see that it's in a window,

37
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.000
in a VirtualBox window.

38
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.750
You can see the menu options from VirtualBox itself.

39
00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.750
So what I'm going to do is simply click

40
00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.200
into this virtual machine and then interact

41
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.200
with it as if it were a real, physical Linux machine

42
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.500
that I'm sitting in front of.

43
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.500
You know, I can do things like

44
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.950
start a terminal or start a web browser

45
00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.950
and I can, ya know, just type right into this system.

46
00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.950
That's really how I recommend you

47
00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.150
go through this course, but again,

48
00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.250
this lesson is for those of you that want to

49
00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.440
connect to a virtual machine like this over the network.

50
00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.650
If you are one of those people that want to

51
00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:03.850
connect to the virtual machine that is

52
00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.250
running on your computer,

53
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.000
you need to do a couple of things

54
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.750
that you may, or may not, have been

55
00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.250
introduced to at this point.

56
00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.750
Unless you have a compelling reason to do so,

57
00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.150
I would suggest waiting until you finish

58
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.450
the other lessons in this course before

59
00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.000
continuing with this lesson.

60
00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.180
The first thing you need to check is

61
00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.750
the network configuration of

62
00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.750
the virtual machine in VirtualBox.

63
00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.450
Make sure that the virtual machine is stopped,

64
00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.750
otherwise you will not be able
to change the configuration

65
00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:32.850
if you need to do so.

66
00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.150
I'm going to highlight the virtual machine

67
00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.400
and click on 'Settings'.

68
00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.750
So here's the machine (virtual machine)

69
00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.750
that I'm working with and I can click

70
00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.600
on 'Settings' up here, or I can even

71
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.000
right-click and click 'Settings' here.

72
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
What we want to do is make sure that the

73
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
network adapter is set to 'Bridged'.

74
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.500
I'll go here and click on 'Network' and

75
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.600
we can see that it says it's set to 'NAT'

76
00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.000
-- it's attached to NAT, so I'm just

77
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.750
going to select 'Bridged Adapter'.

78
00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.750
You <i>can</i> make this work with NAT

79
00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.000
in conjunction with port-forwarding but

80
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.650
it's just simpler to use bridged networking

81
00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.650
in most cases, especially if you are

82
00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.450
working on a typical home network.

83
00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.450
Bridged networking allows the

84
00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.900
virtual machine to exist on the network

85
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.500
just like any other machine.

86
00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.000
It makes it most act like actual hardware.

87
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.260
So now that you have bridged networking

88
00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.450
configured, you can go ahead and start

89
00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:26.650
the virtual machine.

90
00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.650
I'll click 'OK' to save my changes

91
00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.650
and then right-click and 'Start'.

92
00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.750
Unless auto-login is configured,

93
00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.550
you'll have to enter a username

94
00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.600
and password to get access to

95
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:44.750
the Linux system.

96
00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.550
So, to get back to a Linux system

97
00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:49.000
over the network, you need to make sure that

98
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.500
a SSH server is installed and running.

99
00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.500
We can check that by looking at

100
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.200
the process table.

101
00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.200
Let's go ahead and open a terminal.

102
00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.700
We can look at the process table

103
00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.700
by using the 'ps' command.

104
00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.700
In this example, I'm going to use <i>ps -ef</i>

105
00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.700
I'm going to pipe that to grep

106
00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.700
and I'm looking for <i>sshd</i>

107
00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.000
which is the SSH daemon, or the SSH server process.

108
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.500
So, in this case, no <i>sshd</i> process is running.

109
00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.000
We just see the <i>grep</i> command that we just ran

110
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.500
but no <i>sshd</i> process.

111
00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.500
Let's check to see if it's even installed.

112
00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.250
This is an Ubuntu system so

113
00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.000
I'm going to use the <i>dpkg</i> command to

114
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.750
look for a SSH server.

115
00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.750
I'm going to use <i>-l</i> to list the installed packages

116
00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.500
and I'm going to grep for 'ssh-server'.

117
00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.500
If this were a RedHat-based system,

118
00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.250
I would run <i>rpm -qa</i> to query the

119
00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.250
packages that are installed and list them all,

120
00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:52.250
and then grep  for 'ssh-server'.

121
00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:55.950
Since this is not a RedHat-based system,

122
00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:57.550
<i>rpm</i> isn't installed.

123
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.750
But at any rate, when we look -- when we listed

124
00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.500
the packages, we had no SSH server packages returned.

125
00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.000
So that means SSH is not installed.

126
00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.000
On a Ubuntu system, what I need to do

127
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.250
first is run <i>sudo apt-get update</i>

128
00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.460
After I've done the <i>apt-get update</i>,

129
00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:32.250
I'm going to run <i>sudo apt-get install
openssh-server openssh-client</i>

130
00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:35.200
Uh, I'll make sure that the SSH client is installed

131
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.200
so I can connect to other systems

132
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.200
from this system, if I need or want to.

133
00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.180
I'll go ahead and answer 'yes' to

134
00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.180
any of these questions here.

135
00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:49.000
In just a second, you'll see that it gets installed.

136
00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:59.940
If I were on a RedHat-based system

137
00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.940
like RedHat or CentOS or Fedora,

138
00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:06.500
I would use <i>sudo yum</i> and

139
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.000
<i>install openssh-server</i> and

140
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.250
<i>openssh-clients</i>

141
00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:13.500
Remember that the important thing here

142
00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.250
is that you install software

143
00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.250
with root privileges.

144
00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:19.250
So if sudo isn't configured, you

145
00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:21.250
would need to <i>su</i> to the root user

146
00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:24.050
and then run the <i>apt-get</i> or <i>yum</i> commands.

147
00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.500
So now let's look at the process table

148
00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:28.000
and check for <i>sshd</i>

149
00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.000
OK, now that we can see that <i>sshd</i>

150
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.260
is in fact running.

151
00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:37.750
If it wasn't running, I would start it with

152
00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:40.250
<i>sudo service ssh start</i>

153
00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:43.060
and that's for an Ubuntu system.

154
00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:45.060
On RedHat, it's slightly different:

155
00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:48.250
it's <i>sudo service sshd start</i>

156
00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:49.750
but in our case, it's running

157
00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:51.250
so I don't need to do this.

158
00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:54.250
So now that sshd is installed and running

159
00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:56.000
we need to know the IP address

160
00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
of this, uh, virtual machine.

161
00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.750
To get that information, we can

162
00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:03.000
run the <i>/sbin/ip addr</i> command

163
00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:08.250
In this example, there are two network interfaces.

164
00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:10.500
You can see <i>1:</i> and then some information

165
00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:12.500
and then a line that starts with <i>2:</i>

166
00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:15.500
and that is the second network interface.

167
00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:17.500
The first network interface is a

168
00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:20.250
virtual network interface that will be

169
00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:22.000
present on all systems.

170
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.500
It's called the loopback device.

171
00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:27.250
It allows the system to communicate with itself.

172
00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:33.250
Also, it always has the IP address of 127.0.0.1

173
00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:35.750
The other network interface is the one

174
00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:37.750
that we want to pay attention to.

175
00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:40.000
So we'll look at the <i>inet</i> line here

176
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.500
and what appears before the forward slash

177
00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:44.250
is the IP address.

178
00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:47.650
On my system, it's 10.0.0.6

179
00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:49.250
On your system, it's probably

180
00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:51.750
going to be something else.

181
00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:54.380
Finally, let's go ahead and confirm

182
00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:56.500
our username with a <i>whoami</i> command.

183
00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:00.100
And in this case, it's 'adminuser'.

184
00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:03.000
Many times, SSH access is disabled

185
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.550
for the root user for security reasons.

186
00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:07.750
So you'll have to connect to this system

187
00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:09.250
with a different user.

188
00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:11.350
So if you try to connect to system

189
00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:12.750
as root, and it doesn't work,

190
00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:15.000
this is probably why.

191
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
You'll also need to know the password

192
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
for the account, and in this case,

193
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.750
on my system, with the image

194
00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:23.000
I'm using, the username is 'adminuser'

195
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.500
and the password is 'adminuser' as well.

196
00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:27.500
Again, this username and password

197
00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:29.850
will vary from system to system, of course.

198
00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:31.750
My physical computer,

199
00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:35.000
or my host computer, is also running Linux.

200
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.750
In your case, it will probably be

201
00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:38.250
Windows or Mac.

202
00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:40.000
I'm going to open up a terminal

203
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.500
and attempt to connect to the Linux system

204
00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:44.500
that is running in VirtualBox.

205
00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:47.500
If you're on a Mac, this is the exact same process.

206
00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:49.900
Let me go ahead and open up my terminal.

207
00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:53.900
I'm going to run the SSH command:

208
00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:56.650
I'm going to run <i>ssh</i> and then provide

209
00:08:56.650 --> 00:08:59.500
the username, uh, on the remote system.

210
00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:01.500
So on my local system, my username

211
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:03.500
is Jason, but that's not what is on

212
00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:06.250
the remote system, so I have to supply it explicitly.

213
00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:08.650
So I'm going to type in 'adminuser'

214
00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:11.350
use the "at" symbol and then

215
00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:13.450
I'm going to take the IP address

216
00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:15.750
that we got from the <i>ip addr</i> command.

217
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:18.750
So in this example, it's 10.0.0.6

218
00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:20.750
and of course, on your system

219
00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:23.000
it will probably be something different.

220
00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:26.780
It prompts me to verify the key.

221
00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:28.780
I'm going to say 'yes'

222
00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:30.300
and then I need to enter the

223
00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:32.750
adminuser's password

224
00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:34.750
and I hit Enter and here I am,

225
00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:37.300
I'm logged into the virtual machine.

226
00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:41.750
I'm going to go ahead and just exit out

227
00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:43.750
of the virtual machine and I'm going

228
00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:45.550
to demonstrate the use of Putty

229
00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:47.750
for the, uh, people connecting with Putty,

230
00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:49.000
on Windows machines.

231
00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
I'm just going to start Putty here --

232
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.500
I have Putty installed on my Linux system.

233
00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:55.750
To connect via Putty, I'll just click

234
00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:57.750
in the Host Name section here

235
00:09:57.750 --> 00:10:00.250
and enter the IP address of our virtual machine.

236
00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:03.750
In this example, it's 10.0.0.6

237
00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:06.750
and I'll go ahead and click 'Open'.

238
00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:08.750
Here you can see that Putty is

239
00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:10.750
asking you to confirm the host key

240
00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:13.000
and we'll go ahead and click 'Accept'

241
00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.500
and now, we need to type in our username,

242
00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:17.750
which is 'adminuser' for my system

243
00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:20.500
and then the password

244
00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:23.000
and then so now you can see we've

245
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
successfully logged into this virtual machine

246
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
over the network, using Putty.

247
00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:32.000
In this lesson, you learned how to connect

248
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.500
to a Linux virtual machine over the network.

249
00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:36.500
You learned that first, you need to

250
00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:38.500
set the network adapter settings

251
00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:40.250
to bridged networking mode.

252
00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:42.000
You also learned how to make sure

253
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.500
that a SSH server is installed and running.

254
00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:46.500
Next, you were able to get the

255
00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:48.500
IP address of the Linux system

256
00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:51.750
by using the <i>ip addr</i> command.

257
00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:53.750
Keep in mind that you may need

258
00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:56.000
to log into the system using an account

259
00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.750
other than the root account.

260
00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:59.750
Finally, you used the desired account

261
00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:02.500
and IP address to connect to the system

262
00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:05.500
over the network, using a command-line utility,

263
00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:07.500
such as SSH on a Mac or Linux system

264
00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:10.500
or using Putty on a Windows system.
