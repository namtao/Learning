00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.620
In this lesson we will be covering
how to copy files over the network.

2
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.470
You already know how to copy files from
one location to another on the same system

3
00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:14.740
using the CP command.

4
00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.620
But if you want to copy files from your
local work station to a Linux server or

5
00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:22.860
between Linux servers you
need to use SCP or SFTP.

6
00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:31.150
SCP is Secure Copy and
SFTP is SSH file transfer protocol.

7
00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:36.670
Sometimes SFTP is referred to as
secure file transfer protocol.

8
00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.150
SCP and SFTP are both extensions
of the secure shell protocol.

9
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.450
In order to use SCP or
SFTP you need a client.

10
00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.890
Mac and Linux come with SCP and
SFTP command line utilities.

11
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:59.150
If you are running Windows, you can use
the PuTTY Secure Copy client psct.ext and

12
00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:04.530
the PuTTY Secure file
transfer client psftp.exe.

13
00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.315
There are graphical clients as well,
Cyberduck is popular for Mac and

14
00:01:09.315 --> 00:01:13.710
Windows, FileZilla runs on Mac,
Windows, and Linux.

15
00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.830
WinSCP is a Windows only SCP and
SFTP client.

16
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.080
If you're looking for
more interactive experience

17
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.760
where you can examine the local files and
remote files, use SFTP.

18
00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:28.670
With SCP,

19
00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.560
you need to know what files you want
to transfer before issuing the command.

20
00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.080
SCP and SFTP aren't the only ways to
transfer files to remote systems.

21
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.640
Sometimes FTP,
called file transfer protocol, is enabled.

22
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.970
In such cases you can use the built-in
FTP command line client on Linux and

23
00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.700
Mac, or a graphical client like WinSCP for
Windows.

24
00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:00.040
Just be aware that FTP is not a secure
transfer protocol like SCP and SFTP.

25
00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.850
This means that your login credentials
are sent in plain text over the network.

26
00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.540
Also that the files that you upload and
download are not encrypted either.

27
00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:15.340
If given the choice between SCP,
SFTP or FTP, pick SCP or SFTP.

28
00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.595
Let's use our SFTP client to
connect to this Linux server.

29
00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.250
When you connect to the remote server,
you're placed into your home directory.

30
00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.400
And LS will show the files
that are in my home directory.

31
00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.680
If you precede those commands
with an L that's for local.

32
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.480
So, lpwd says that I'm in
the local tmp test directory.

33
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.335
And lls will show what files
are on the local box in tmp test.

34
00:02:48.335 --> 00:02:56.600
So let's put z.txt onto the server and
we'll do an ls.

35
00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.840
And we can see that z.txt
shows up on the remote server.

36
00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.290
Let's delete it off the remote server.

37
00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.370
And let's do an ls with a dash l for
a long listing and see if it's gone.

38
00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:11.790
And it is.

39
00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.990
So we'll quit our SFTP client.

40
00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:18.820
With SCP you can copy from your
local system to the remote system,

41
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.810
but you need to know the source and
destination.

42
00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.610
So our source file will be z.txt.

43
00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.610
Our destination will be linuxsvr1.

44
00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.140
Append a colon at the end of the server
name followed by a path name.

45
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.095
We could put this file in the tmp
directory on the remote server.

46
00:03:42.095 --> 00:03:46.425
We could put this file in
say our home directory.

47
00:03:46.425 --> 00:03:48.510
Tilda is a shortcut for home.

48
00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:55.686
Let's connect to the Linux server and

49
00:03:55.686 --> 00:04:01.590
show that we did place the z.txt there,
and also in tmp.

50
00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:11.810
Let's transfer this file to the remote
server as a different user.

51
00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.320
Let's use adminuser@linuxsvr.

52
00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:19.210
And we'll place this in
the adminuser's home directory.

53
00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:23.710
Okay and we can use Tilda as a shortcut
for home or we can specify the full path.

54
00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:24.305
Let's just do that.

55
00:04:29.955 --> 00:04:31.180
And let's connect.

56
00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:32.830
It's the same with SFTP.

57
00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:38.515
Let's connect to SFTP
adminuser@linuxserver.

58
00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.000
And you can see that
z.txt was transferred.

59
00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:51.490
Let's look at using a graphical
client like Filezilla.

60
00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:57.550
To connect via SFTP type SFTP;; and
then the IP address or server name.

61
00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.425
And give a username and
password and click quick connect.

62
00:05:04.465 --> 00:05:08.550
If you get prompted about an SSH key,
go ahead and accept it.

63
00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:09.870
And this is a one-time thing.

64
00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.080
On the left side you see our local
files on our work station, and

65
00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.411
on the right side are the remote
files on the Linux server.

66
00:05:17.411 --> 00:05:21.030
We'll just pick a file to
transfer up to our Linux server.

67
00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.910
Let's put it in our desktop folder.

68
00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:28.240
And you can drag and

69
00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.740
drop the file from local to remote,
also from remote to local.

70
00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:36.300
And you can also do a transfer by
double clicking the file as well.

71
00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.420
Let's login to our Linux server and

72
00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:43.920
see if those files got
transferred like we expected.

73
00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:57.670
And we can see that the file is on
the desktop, double click to open.

74
00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:58.510
Yep, it made it.

75
00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:07.420
Let's look at our documents folder and
we can see the file is there as well.

76
00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:13.330
To transfer files over
the network you need a client.

77
00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:18.410
There are command line clients like SCP,
SFTP and FTP.

78
00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:24.670
You can also you a graphical client
such as Cyberduck, FileZilla or WinSCP.

79
00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:31.506
If you have a choice to use FTP or
SFTP choose SFTP.
