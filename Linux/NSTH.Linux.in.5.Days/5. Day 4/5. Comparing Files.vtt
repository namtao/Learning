00:00:02.933 --> 00:00:06.240
This lesson will cover how to
compare the contents of files.

2
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.920
If you want to compare two files and
display the differences,

3
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.020
you can use the diff command.

4
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.150
The Sdiff command or vimdiff.

5
00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.570
The diff command will display
the differences between two files.

6
00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.090
While the sdiff command will display
the differences with file1 on the left and

7
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.630
file2 on the right.

8
00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:32.330
Vimdiff will use the vim editor to display
the differences between two files.

9
00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.880
Here's just the first line
of output produced by diff.

10
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.310
The first number represents line
numbers from the first file and

11
00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.120
the second number represents line
numbers from the second file.

12
00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.750
The middle character separating
the line numbers will either be a C,

13
00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.390
which represents a change, D,
which represents a deletion, or

14
00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.280
an A which represents an addition.

15
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.470
In this example the third line
of the first file is changed or

16
00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.865
different than the third
line in the second file.

17
00:00:59.865 --> 00:01:04.905
This is an example of an entire
output from the diff command.

18
00:01:04.905 --> 00:01:09.035
The output that follows the less
than sign belongs to the first file.

19
00:01:09.035 --> 00:01:12.095
The text following the greater than
sign belongs to the second file.

20
00:01:13.115 --> 00:01:14.935
The three dashes are just a separator.

21
00:01:16.975 --> 00:01:18.815
In the sdiff output, the pipe or

22
00:01:18.815 --> 00:01:23.265
vertical bar character means that the text
differs in the files on that line.

23
00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.990
You may also see the less than sign,

24
00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.810
which means that the line only
exists in the first file.

25
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.960
The greater than sign means that
line only exists in the second file.

26
00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.350
When you run vimdiff, both files will
be pulled up in separate windows.

27
00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.680
To switch between the windows,
type CTL+WW.

28
00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.610
To close the current file in
the current window, type :q, Enter.

29
00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.380
If you want to close both files
at once and quit, type :qa, and

30
00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.070
if you've made some changes that you
don't want to save you can type :qa!

31
00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.710
Enter.

32
00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.650
We'll use the -n option for
the cat command to display line numbers.

33
00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.870
Let's use the diff command to look at
the differences between those two files.

34
00:02:19.145 --> 00:02:23.151
You'll notice that the line that begins
with the less than symbol belongs

35
00:02:23.151 --> 00:02:24.184
to the first file,

36
00:02:24.184 --> 00:02:28.080
while the line with the greater than
symbol belongs to the second file.

37
00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:34.050
You'll also notice the first
line of diff output says 4c4.

38
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.820
That means the fourth line of
the first file is changed or

39
00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.000
different than the fourth
line of the second file.

40
00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:42.091
Let's use sdiff.

41
00:02:46.311 --> 00:02:51.122
And you can see that it places the files
side by side, and the vertical bar, or

42
00:02:51.122 --> 00:02:54.839
the pipe symbol,
displays the line that has a difference.

43
00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:05.810
Let's add a new last line to this file.

44
00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:06.400
We'll append it.

45
00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.060
And we'll run sdiff again.

46
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:15.110
And this time you can see that
the less than sign represents that

47
00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.820
there's a line in the first file
that is not in the second file.

48
00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:21.296
We'll use vimdiff.

49
00:03:25.976 --> 00:03:30.220
You can see that vim is highlighting
the differences between the files.

50
00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.710
We can use CTL+WW to move between windows.

51
00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:40.900
And if you wanna close one window,
q, :q to close the other window.

52
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.710
Let's do that again and
we'll close both of them at the same time.

53
00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:47.878
You can look at the differences and

54
00:03:47.878 --> 00:03:51.336
:qa Enter to exit vimdiff.

55
00:03:54.356 --> 00:03:59.158
In this lesson we covered the diff command
which displays the differences between two

56
00:03:59.158 --> 00:04:02.624
files, the sdiff command which
does the same thing except for

57
00:04:02.624 --> 00:04:05.359
it displays the differences
side-by-side and

58
00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:09.176
the vimdiff command which displays
differences in the vim editor.
