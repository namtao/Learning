00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.430
This lesson covers creating,
deleting and persisting aliases.

2
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.030
If you find yourself typing
the same command over and

3
00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:15.150
over again, you can create a shortcut for
it called an alias.

4
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.630
An alias can be thought
of as a text expander.

5
00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.370
Creating aliases for
commands that are really long, or

6
00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:24.860
that you use often is a common practice.

7
00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:30.360
For example, if you type ls-l frequently,
you may want to abbreviate it to ll.

8
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.090
As a matter of fact,

9
00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.450
this alias often comes predefined
in many Linux distributions.

10
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.055
The alias command can list or
create aliases.

11
00:00:39.055 --> 00:00:42.495
If you run alias without any additional
information on the command line,

12
00:00:42.495 --> 00:00:45.755
it displays the list of
current aliases that are set.

13
00:00:45.755 --> 00:00:48.555
If you want to create an alias use alias,

14
00:00:48.555 --> 00:00:53.165
space, the alias name equals and
the value for that alias.

15
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.270
Aliases don't have to be used for
just shortcuts.

16
00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.680
They can be used to fix
common typing errors.

17
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.560
For example if you end up typing grpe,
when you mean to type grep,

18
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.190
you can create an alias, and
whenever you accidentally type grpe,

19
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.270
alias will fix that for
you, and spell it grep.

20
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.280
You can also use aliases to
make your work environment

21
00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.530
similar to that of another platform.

22
00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.850
For instance,
in Windows cls clears the screen, but

23
00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.830
in Linux the equivalent command is clear.

24
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.380
You could create the shortcuts
to make you feel more at home.

25
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.980
To remove an alias type, unalias and
the name of the alias, or

26
00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:40.690
to remove all aliases use,
unalias space -a.

27
00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.530
If you were to create some aliases and
log out and

28
00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.410
back in, your aliases would be lost.

29
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.790
To make them persist between sessions,
add them to your dot files,

30
00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.520
such as .bash_profile.

31
00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.380
The downside to creating several aliases
is that when you're on a system that does

32
00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.070
not have your aliases,
you might feel lost.

33
00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.860
If you want to be able to work effectively
on any Linux system that you have access

34
00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.850
to, keep your alias usage to a minimum.

35
00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.320
Another way to handle this
situation is to simply copy,

36
00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.360
your configuration files to each Linux
system that you're going to work on.

37
00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.720
Let's say you run ls-l a lot.

38
00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.060
Let's make this an alias, make it shorter.

39
00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.070
Let's alias ll to be ls-l.

40
00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:29.139
So now when you type ll, you'll get
the same result as when you type ls-l.

41
00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.790
Let's say you like to type cls because
you come from a Windows background.

42
00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.820
Cls is not available on Linux.

43
00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.990
The equivalent command is clear.

44
00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.760
You could create an alias for
cls that equals clear.

45
00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.140
So now when you type cls
it will clear the screen.

46
00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.510
To list aliases just
use the alias command.

47
00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.788
To make them persist you can
edit your bash_profile file.

48
00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:03.129
Let's do this.

49
00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:05.909
Let's add mycls.

50
00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:11.109
We can see that, that's not set.

51
00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:14.489
Let's log out and log back in.

52
00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.328
And you can see that mycls is set.

53
00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:29.807
The alias command lists and
creates aliases,

54
00:03:29.807 --> 00:03:33.530
while the unaliases
command deletes aliases.

55
00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.640
To persist your aliases between
login's add them to your dot files.
