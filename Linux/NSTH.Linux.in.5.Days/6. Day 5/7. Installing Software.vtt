00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:07.585
In this lesson, we will be covering
packages, package managers, and

2
00:00:07.585 --> 00:00:13.310
how to find, install, and remove software
for the most popular Linux distributions.

3
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.840
Typically, when you install software in
a Linux system you do so with a package.

4
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.120
A package is just a collection of
files that make up an application.

5
00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:27.460
Additionally a package contains data about
the application as well as any steps

6
00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.910
required to successfully install and
remove that application.

7
00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:32.504
The data or

8
00:00:32.504 --> 00:00:36.733
metadata that is contained within
a package can include such information as

9
00:00:36.733 --> 00:00:41.225
the description of the application, the
version and the list of dependencies or

10
00:00:41.225 --> 00:00:45.606
other packages that this particular
application needs in order to function.

11
00:00:47.351 --> 00:00:53.290
A package manager is used to install,
upgrade, and remove packages.

12
00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.100
The package manager uses
a package's metadata to

13
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.820
automatically install any
required dependencies.

14
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.840
Package managers keep track of what
files belong to what packages,

15
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.080
what packages are installed, and what
versions of those packages are installed.

16
00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:15.030
Here is a list of distributions that
are based on the RPM package format.

17
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.370
RPM stands for RedHat Package Manager.

18
00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.130
Obviously, the RedHat distribution
uses RPMs, as well as,

19
00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.350
CentOS, Fedora, Oracle Linux,
and Scientific Linux.

20
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.610
The yum command line utility is
a packaged management program for

21
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.070
those Linux distributions
that use RPM packages.

22
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.051
You can find packages to install with yum
search and provide that a search string.

23
00:01:40.051 --> 00:01:43.599
You can also display
information about a package or

24
00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:47.570
an application by using yum,
info and the package name.

25
00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.900
You can install packages with
the yum install package command.

26
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.390
Yum will typically ask you to
review your request and say yes or

27
00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:57.670
no if you want to continue.

28
00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.055
To automatically answer yes
to yum's question use -y.

29
00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.000
Also note that installing or
removing software requires root or

30
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.360
super user privileges.

31
00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.241
To remove a package, it's simply yum
remove and the name of the package.

32
00:02:14.241 --> 00:02:17.022
In addition to the yum command,

33
00:02:17.022 --> 00:02:22.920
you can also use the rpm command to
interact with a package manager.

34
00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.592
Rpm -qa lists all the installed packages.

35
00:02:26.592 --> 00:02:32.806
Rpm -qf with a path to a file will tell
you what package that file belongs to.

36
00:02:32.806 --> 00:02:37.752
Using rpm -ql package name
will list all the files

37
00:02:37.752 --> 00:02:41.890
that belong to that particular package.

38
00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:49.400
To install a package,
use rpm -ivh and the package file.

39
00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.960
To erase or uninstall a package,
use rpm -e with a package name.

40
00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.990
Let's look for an application to install.

41
00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.280
Let's look for something called inkscape.

42
00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.038
So we'll do a search.

43
00:03:05.686 --> 00:03:08.810
And then we see three items returned.

44
00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:15.140
Let's do yum info on each one of those and
see what they do inkscape-docs.

45
00:03:18.701 --> 00:03:22.070
It says it's a tutorial and
examples for Inkscape.

46
00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:24.660
That's not what we're looking for,
let's look at the next one.

47
00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:26.640
Two is Inkscape.

48
00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:33.000
And that says it's a graphics editor so
that is the package that we want.

49
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.790
So in order to install or
remove software we need root privileges.

50
00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.480
We can use sudo if that's configured or
we can also just switch to the root user.

51
00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.300
Now I'll just switch to root and use
adminuser as the password for this server.

52
00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.241
Then we'll do yum install inkscape.

53
00:03:55.271 --> 00:03:57.610
So is it okay to download this?

54
00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:58.860
Yes it is.

55
00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:59.981
I'll hit y and Enter.

56
00:04:14.134 --> 00:04:17.130
All right, it's says it
installed their package there.

57
00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.460
You can also use yum install with a -y,

58
00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:23.260
so you don't have to answer
y to the question here.

59
00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.731
We'll do this with another
piece of software called GIMP.

60
00:04:33.011 --> 00:04:35.635
And you can see that this
has several dependencies,

61
00:04:35.635 --> 00:04:37.721
so it not only installs the application,

62
00:04:37.721 --> 00:04:41.671
but it installs the other packages that
are required for GIMP to run properly.

63
00:04:53.811 --> 00:04:57.815
Okay, let's look in our
applications list for graphics,

64
00:04:57.815 --> 00:05:03.580
and you can see that Inkscape and
GIMP has been installed on our system.

65
00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.820
Let's remove some
software with yum remove.

66
00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:08.720
We'll do this to GIMP.

67
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.311
And then like install you could use
-y to answer yes automatically.

68
00:05:16.131 --> 00:05:17.601
I'll just do it manually here.

69
00:05:17.601 --> 00:05:20.620
And it says it erased that package.

70
00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.806
Let's look.
Applications, graphics and

71
00:05:22.806 --> 00:05:25.561
GIMP is no longer showing up in our menu.

72
00:05:29.881 --> 00:05:33.676
Let's say there's some software that you
want to install that's not included in

73
00:05:33.676 --> 00:05:34.721
the package manager.

74
00:05:37.971 --> 00:05:39.410
Let's look for Dropbox.

75
00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:46.803
So you can't use yum to install Dropbox,
or at least directly, so

76
00:05:46.803 --> 00:05:48.691
we'll go to dropbox.com.

77
00:05:58.371 --> 00:05:59.911
Download the RPM.

78
00:06:01.761 --> 00:06:09.110
Let's save them, this directory here.

79
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:14.110
So, we can install an rpm with -i for
install, v is verbose,

80
00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:17.770
and h says print some hash
marks to show our progress.

81
00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:18.681
So we'll just do that here.

82
00:06:22.601 --> 00:06:24.070
We'll answer OK.

83
00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.960
Dropbox was successfully installed.

84
00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.855
So, can see.

85
00:06:35.364 --> 00:06:36.670
There it is, Dropbox.

86
00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:37.750
We installed Dropbox.

87
00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:43.570
You could also use rpm to do some queries.

88
00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:48.440
So, we'll use rpm -qa to
query all packages, or

89
00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:50.680
to list all packages that
are installed on the system.

90
00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:54.770
And then when we do this we can see
that they're in no particular order.

91
00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.840
We'll sort the list so
it makes it easier for us to read.

92
00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:03.260
We'll sort it and pipe it to a pager so
we can look at it one page at a time.

93
00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:06.870
And there we go.

94
00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:09.640
Yeah, all the way to the end,
you can see yum, zlib, etc.

95
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.520
So, you can also ask rpm what
file a package belongs to.

96
00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:20.510
So the program which
lives at user bin which.

97
00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:23.990
We'll ask rpm what package
does that belong to.

98
00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:26.900
And it's the which package.

99
00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:29.190
You can also say show me all the files or

100
00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:31.220
list all the files that
are in that package.

101
00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:33.710
We'll just give it the package name.

102
00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:37.204
And you can see that user bin which,
in addition to these other files,

103
00:07:37.204 --> 00:07:39.406
are contained in that particular package.

104
00:07:42.831 --> 00:07:47.760
Another popular package format
is the Debian package format.

105
00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:52.600
In addition to Debian, distributions like
Linux Mint and Ubuntu use DEB packages.

106
00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:57.440
The Debian base distributions use
a package manager called APT.

107
00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:58.651
The advance packaging tool.

108
00:07:58.651 --> 00:08:02.052
APT is comprised of a few
small utilities with

109
00:08:02.052 --> 00:08:06.900
the two most commonly used ones
being apt -cache and apt-get.

110
00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:12.000
To search for packages, use apt-cache
search, and the search string.

111
00:08:13.128 --> 00:08:17.800
To install the package, use apt-get,
install and the package name.

112
00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:22.960
You can use -y to automatically answer
yes to any of apt-get's questions.

113
00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:27.700
To remove a package, use apt-get remove.

114
00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:31.760
If there are any configuration files,
or configuration changes,

115
00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:35.370
those will stay on your
system with apt-get remove.

116
00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:39.170
However, if you wanna get rid of the
configuration in addition to the package,

117
00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:41.389
you can use apt-get purge package.

118
00:08:43.290 --> 00:08:47.310
To show information about a particular
package, use apt-cache show and

119
00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:48.060
the package name.

120
00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:51.200
In addition to the app utilities,

121
00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:55.080
you can use the dpkg command to
interact with the package manager.

122
00:08:55.080 --> 00:09:00.103
Dpkg -l lists the installed packages.

123
00:09:00.103 --> 00:09:01.345
Dpkg space -S and

124
00:09:01.345 --> 00:09:06.545
a path to a file, will display
the package that the file belongs to.

125
00:09:07.835 --> 00:09:12.535
Dpkg with a -L lists all
the files in a package.

126
00:09:12.535 --> 00:09:17.051
And to install a package,
use dpkg space -i and the .deb file.

127
00:09:19.801 --> 00:09:23.830
Here we are on an Ubuntu system.

128
00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:27.366
Let's use app to look for
and install some software.

129
00:09:30.051 --> 00:09:35.350
Look for inkscape and the first result
returned there looks like what we want.

130
00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:39.030
Let's take a look at it
with app cache show.

131
00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:47.947
Give some information about the package,
its dependencies, its description.

132
00:09:51.791 --> 00:09:56.670
So we will install that
with apt-get install.

133
00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:01.940
And installing and removing
software requires root privileges.

134
00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:05.860
You can get root privileges by using
the sudo command, that's one way.

135
00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:07.416
You can also switch to the root account.

136
00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.210
Do I want to continue?

137
00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:17.401
Yes, we'll install this software.

138
00:10:35.058 --> 00:10:36.798
Okay now the software
installation is done.

139
00:10:36.798 --> 00:10:38.868
We can see if we can find it.

140
00:10:43.321 --> 00:10:45.661
And, sure enough,
we can see that it's installed.

141
00:10:51.321 --> 00:10:55.540
You can also just answer yes
to apt's question with a -y.

142
00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:57.811
So, we'll go ahead and
install GIMP this way.

143
00:11:05.471 --> 00:11:07.260
Okay GIMP is installed.

144
00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:10.250
Now we can see there it is.

145
00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:12.420
So we'll go ahead and just remove it.

146
00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:15.480
We'll do app-get remove.

147
00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:18.531
Again we need root privileges to add or
remove software.

148
00:11:27.481 --> 00:11:29.331
And GIMP is now gone from the system.

149
00:11:29.331 --> 00:11:34.461
Let's look at that stalling
software from a .deb file.

150
00:11:44.921 --> 00:11:46.680
I'm on Ubuntu here.

151
00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:48.391
Let's download the .deb for Ubuntu.

152
00:12:07.671 --> 00:12:10.731
Going to use dpkg-i to
do the installation.

153
00:12:18.091 --> 00:12:20.190
And Dropbox is installed.

154
00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:26.181
We can use dpkg -l to list
all the installed packages.

155
00:12:34.801 --> 00:12:41.036
Let's see, let's use dpg -S and
see which file,

156
00:12:41.036 --> 00:12:46.550
which package the which
command belongs to.

157
00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:52.550
It belongs to the debianutils package,
so we can look at

158
00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:57.420
all the files in the debianutils
package with the -L command.

159
00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:02.135
Let's, yeah, you can see at
the very bottom, user bin which.

160
00:13:05.201 --> 00:13:10.350
Packages are used to install
software on Linux systems.

161
00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:12.695
You can manipulate packages
with a package manager.

162
00:13:12.695 --> 00:13:18.456
Two of the most package
formats are RPM and Debian.

163
00:13:18.456 --> 00:13:26.015
For RPN based distributions, use the yum
and RPM commands to manage packages.

164
00:13:26.015 --> 00:13:31.225
For Debian based distributions use apt and
dpkg to manage packages
