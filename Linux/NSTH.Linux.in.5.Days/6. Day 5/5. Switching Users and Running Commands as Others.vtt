00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.920
This lesson will cover How
switch to other accounts and

2
00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.410
How to run commands and
programs as other users.

3
00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:16.320
One way to start a session as another user
on the system is to use the su command.

4
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.810
If no arguments are supplied to su,

5
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.350
it assumes that you are trying to
become the superuser or root account.

6
00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:29.850
Executing su without any options is
the same thing as executing su space root.

7
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:34.230
Your current environment is passed to the
new shell unless you specify a hyphen or

8
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.380
a dash.

9
00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.150
In that case, su creates an environment
like you would expect to see had you

10
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:40.858
logged in as that user.

11
00:00:40.858 --> 00:00:47.430
Use the -c option to su,
to specify a command to be executed.

12
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.930
If the command you want to execute
is more than one word in length,

13
00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.840
then you need to surround it with quotes.

14
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.680
If you want to know what user you
are working as, run the whoami command.

15
00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.890
If you run whoami, it should
return your current account name.

16
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.560
And after you su or

17
00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.430
switch to another user, whoami should
return that user account's name.

18
00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.870
Let's set an environment
variable to test with.

19
00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:12.930
Let's set TEST = 1.

20
00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:19.482
Now, let's use the su command to switch
to the oracle user for instance.

21
00:01:24.083 --> 00:01:26.641
And you can see that that
environment variable is passed on.

22
00:01:26.641 --> 00:01:31.323
Our environment exists after
we changed to the oracle user.

23
00:01:36.581 --> 00:01:40.475
Let's use use su with a dash
to get oracle's environment.

24
00:01:45.615 --> 00:01:50.035
And you can see that our environment
variable of TEST was not passed on when we

25
00:01:50.035 --> 00:01:52.875
su space dash to the oracle user.

26
00:01:54.965 --> 00:01:57.955
Also, we ended up in
the oracle's home directory.

27
00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:04.970
Let's pass a command.

28
00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:13.030
Let's do this, echo, ORACLE_HOME and
nothing was returned.

29
00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.410
We didn't specify that we wanted
oracle's environment, rather

30
00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.920
we used our environment, let's use a dash
to say, let's get oracle's environment.

31
00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.530
And now you can see that that environment
variable that exists in the oracle account

32
00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:28.560
is accessible to us.

33
00:02:32.001 --> 00:02:33.714
Another way to switch users or

34
00:02:33.714 --> 00:02:37.485
execute commands as others
is to use the sudo command.

35
00:02:37.485 --> 00:02:42.605
Sudo allows you to run programs with
the security privileges of another user.

36
00:02:42.605 --> 00:02:45.195
Like su, if no username is specified,

37
00:02:45.195 --> 00:02:48.915
it assumes that you were trying to
run commands as the super user.

38
00:02:48.915 --> 00:02:52.252
This is why sudo is referred
to as superuser do.

39
00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.540
It is commonly used to install, start and

40
00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.870
stop applications that
require root privileges.

41
00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.600
One of the advantages of using sudo
over the su command is that you

42
00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.340
don't need to know the password
of the other user.

43
00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.880
This could eliminate some issues that
arise from using shared passwords in

44
00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.430
generic accounts.

45
00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.310
When you execute the sudo command,
you are prompted for your password.

46
00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.890
If the sudo configuration permits access,
that command is executed.

47
00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.050
The sudo configuration is typically
controlled by the system administrator,

48
00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.770
and requires root access to change.

49
00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:28.300
Of course, on your personal system,
you have access to the root account, and

50
00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.090
you are effectively the system
administrator, as well.

51
00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:39.620
To see the commands that are available for
you to run with sudo, use sudo -l.

52
00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.130
To run a command as the root user,

53
00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.080
just run sudo space the command
you want to execute.

54
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.072
You can specify a user with -u.

55
00:03:49.072 --> 00:03:55.500
So sudo -u root command is the exact
same thing as sudo command.

56
00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.260
However, if you want to run
a command as another user,

57
00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.372
you need to specify that with -u.

58
00:04:00.372 --> 00:04:04.000
So, sudo -u oracle command, for example.

59
00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.860
You can use sudo su to switch
to the superuser account.

60
00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:15.430
If you use sudo su- and hit enter

61
00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.660
you get switched to the superuser
account with the root's environment.

62
00:04:19.845 --> 00:04:26.630
Sudo su dash a username would
switch to that username's account,

63
00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.450
with an environment that you would expect
to see, had you logged in as that user.

64
00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.600
Another way to switch to another account
with sudo is to use the -s option.

65
00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.350
If you run sudo -s that
will start a shell as root.

66
00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.850
You can specify a user with the -u option.

67
00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.670
We can use the sudo -l command to see
what commands we can run with sudo.

68
00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:56.750
In this case it looks like
it can run any command and

69
00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.940
I don't even need to specify a password.

70
00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.550
Here's an example where you would use
sudo to execute a commando's route.

71
00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.020
For instance,
let's start an application called oracle.

72
00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:12.290
You could also run

73
00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:17.070
sudo with -u to run programs
as other users besides route.

74
00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:19.160
So let's run something as the user bob.

75
00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:25.030
And let's say we need to stop
start bob's app as the user bob.

76
00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:31.820
And that worked, and
that program is running as bob.

77
00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:38.820
Let's switch to the oracle account, and
you can see that I'm the oracle user.

78
00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:43.420
And now I'm back to my
normal jason account, and

79
00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:46.750
I can also use sudo with a -s.

80
00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:49.790
Let's do that to change
to the root account.

81
00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.630
And you can see that I'm a root
account and I'm at my home directory.

82
00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:03.200
Let's do this another way, you can also
switch to the root account with sudo su,

83
00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.010
or even sudo su- to get roots environment.

84
00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:14.290
If you need to modify the sudo
configuration, use the command visudo.

85
00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:18.620
It effectively starts the vi editor and
edits the etc sudoers file.

86
00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.770
The visudo command has to be
executed with approved privileges.

87
00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:28.460
This means that you either need to switch
to the root account, and run visudo, for

88
00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:32.410
example, su root, then run visudo.

89
00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:36.700
Or run sudo visudo as your own account.

90
00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:42.770
The sudoers file contains a list of users,
and what commands that those

91
00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:47.350
users can run and as what users
those commands can be run as.

92
00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:50.830
There are many options
to the sudoers file,

93
00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:54.470
but the most simple format and
one that you'll see quite often

94
00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:59.190
Is a line that gives a specific user
a set of commands that he or she can run.

95
00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:03.540
The specification starts with the user
that is getting the sudo privilege,

96
00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:08.460
followed by the host on which that
user can execute those privileges on.

97
00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:12.900
This allows system administrators to
use one sudoers configuration file and

98
00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:14.669
distribute that to multiple servers.

99
00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:19.860
The user listed in parenthesis is
the user the commands will run as.

100
00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:24.850
Finally a list of commands is
provided that the user can run.

101
00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:27.930
You can separate multiple
commands with a comma

102
00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:31.930
also if you don't require that a password
be entered when using sudo you

103
00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:35.139
can supply the no password
decorator in front of the commands.

104
00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:40.330
Use the su command to switch users.

105
00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:43.260
To get the users environment
that you're switching to,

106
00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:44.950
remember to use a hyphen or a dash.

107
00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:49.780
The whoami command displays
your current account name.

108
00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:54.471
The sudo command allows you to
execute programs as other users.

109
00:07:54.471 --> 00:08:00.350
To switch users with sudo,
use sudo -s, or sudo su.

110
00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:04.910
If you need to change the sudoers
configuration use the visudo command

111
00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:06.320
to edit the sudoers file.
