00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:06.330
Congratulations on making
it to the end of course.

2
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.320
We've covered a lot of
topics along the way.

3
00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.790
First, you started out by learning
what Linux is, how it came to be, and

4
00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.070
some of its strengths and weaknesses.

5
00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.510
Then you learned how to gain
access to a Linux system so

6
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.640
you could practice your skills.

7
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.920
You got an introduction to
the command line interface and

8
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.720
started using some basic commands.

9
00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.360
Next, you learned how to
manipulate files and directories.

10
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.450
You also learned how to use the nano,
vi, and emacs editors.

11
00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.560
You conquered obscure
Linux permissions and

12
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.790
learned about I/O redirection and pipes.

13
00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.950
Along the way you learned about how
to customize your environment, and

14
00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.440
picked up some tips at becoming
efficient at the command line.

15
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.954
At this point, you not only know
the fundamentals of the Linux operating

16
00:00:49.954 --> 00:00:53.770
system, but you can also use your
knowledge to accomplish worthwhile tasks.

17
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.700
Please let me know how this
course has helped you, and

18
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.760
if there is anything I can do for you.

19
00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.071
I hope to see you again in
another one of my courses.

20
00:01:01.071 --> 00:01:01.571
Thanks.
