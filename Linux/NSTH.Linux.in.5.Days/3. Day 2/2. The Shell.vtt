00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:08.020
In today's lesson, you will learn what
the shell is, how to access it, and

2
00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.320
we'll talk a little bit
about the superuser account.

3
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.910
The Shell is the default user
interface to a Linux system.

4
00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.760
When you log in to a Linux server over the
network, the Shell is the program that is

5
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.620
started and it acts as your
default interface to the system.

6
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.510
Also, if you're presented with
a text based login prompt,

7
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.930
you'll also be interacting
with a shell by default.

8
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.330
If you login to a graphical user
interface, then you'll need to start

9
00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.490
a terminal emulator application
to gain access to the shell.

10
00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.562
In CentOS, for example,

11
00:00:41.562 --> 00:00:46.480
you can go to the Applications
menu > System Tools > Terminal.

12
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.530
In Ubuntu, you need to start
a program called The Dash.

13
00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.480
To do that, you click on the top icon and

14
00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.140
the launcher, which is on the left
hand side of your screen.

15
00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.190
It's the icon with the Ubuntu logo on it.

16
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.580
Start typing the word terminal and
you should see the terminal

17
00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.220
application pop up, and
you can click on it to start it.

18
00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.320
The graphical user interface on
a Linux system is also called a shell.

19
00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.260
Its a graphical shell.

20
00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.870
However, if someone isn't specific and

21
00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.480
they say shell, they're typically talking
about the command line interface.

22
00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.980
The shell is really nothing more
than an application or program

23
00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.790
that takes the command you feed it, and
it executes those commands for you.

24
00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.120
Sometimes, you'll hear the Shell refered
to as a command line interpreter.

25
00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.210
The command line interface can be more
powerful than the graphical interface.

26
00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.570
For example, if you have several files and
you need to perform the same operation on

27
00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.480
those files,
you can often do this easily at the shell.

28
00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.820
For example, if you had 100
documents that you needed to rename

29
00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.390
you could run a command at
the shell to do all 100 at once.

30
00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.880
If you were using the graphical user
interface, you would have to click on

31
00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.820
the first file, rename it,
go to the next file and do that 100 times.

32
00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.700
In this instance, the command
line is a much better solution.

33
00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.220
Another reason you wanna be
familiar with the command line and

34
00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.820
be able to use it effectively,
is that it's always going to be there.

35
00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.060
Most server additions of Linux
distributions do not include

36
00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.654
a graphical interface.

37
00:02:21.515 --> 00:02:24.245
Also, when you're connecting to
a Linux system over the network,

38
00:02:24.245 --> 00:02:29.535
you're typically going to be
connecting via SSH, or secure shell.

39
00:02:29.535 --> 00:02:31.975
This will give you access to
the command line interface as well.

40
00:02:33.635 --> 00:02:37.685
Desktop Linux distributions have
both graphical user interfaces

41
00:02:37.685 --> 00:02:39.455
as well as command line interfaces.

42
00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.370
This allows you to have
the best of both worlds.

43
00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.650
When it makes sense to use the command
line, use the command line.

44
00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.960
When it makes sense to use a graphical
program, use that program.

45
00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.770
For example, if I'm working on a Linux
desktop and I want to visit Wikipedia

46
00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:00.570
on the web, I would start a graphical
web browser like Firefox, for instance.

47
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.620
There are command line web
browsers that come with Lennox.

48
00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.850
So you can surf the web
from the command line.

49
00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.020
Given the choice of using
the command line for web browsing or

50
00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.030
a graphical web browser such as Firefox,
I would choose Firefox any day.

51
00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.030
When the shell is started,
it displays a prompt or a shell prompt.

52
00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.850
The prompt simply just sits there and
stares at you, waiting for

53
00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.840
you to do something interesting,
like give it a command to execute.

54
00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.140
A shell prompt typically gives you
some sort of useful information.

55
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.890
In this example prompt,
you will see a user name, jason@,

56
00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.000
and the name of the Linux system
that you are connected to.

57
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.570
In this case, linuxsvr or Linux server.

58
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.820
At the end of the prompt,
you'll see a dollar sign.

59
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:50.570
This is an indication that you're using
the system as a normal user as opposed

60
00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:51.430
to a super user.

61
00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.849
The superuser shell point ends
typically with a pound sign.

62
00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:01.300
The superuser on a Linux
system is also called root.

63
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:02.490
It's the root account.

64
00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:08.825
We've previously talked about the root
of the file system or / being root.

65
00:04:08.825 --> 00:04:10.255
This is a different root.

66
00:04:10.255 --> 00:04:12.745
This is an account called root.

67
00:04:12.745 --> 00:04:16.695
So when someone talks about root,
they're either talking about /,

68
00:04:16.695 --> 00:04:20.565
the beginning of the file system or
the superuser account named root.

69
00:04:22.625 --> 00:04:27.025
The root account on a Linux system is
similar to an administrator account

70
00:04:27.025 --> 00:04:28.800
on a Windows system.

71
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.270
Anything that can be done on a Linux
system can be done by the root user.

72
00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.590
Normal user accounts can only
do a subset of the things

73
00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.660
that the root account can do.

74
00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.450
Most of your day-to-day activities will
be performed with a normal user account.

75
00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.870
Root access is typically
restricted system administrators.

76
00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.120
For example, if you're a working in
a company and you have access to Linux

77
00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.820
servers, there will be a team of
people that are responsible for

78
00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:59.300
the upkeep, maintenance, and
configuration of those servers.

79
00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.320
And those people
are system administrators.

80
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.530
Sometimes there are not dedicated
people that are system administrators.

81
00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.090
For example,
if you're running Linux on your desktop,

82
00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:10.920
you'll have access to a normal
user account and the root account.

83
00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.170
You may need root access if you're
going to install an application

84
00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:18.080
that resides outside of
your home directory.

85
00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:23.730
You also may need root access in order
to start or stop that application.

86
00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:25.780
Applications that run as services or

87
00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.450
servers typically need
root access to start.

88
00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.410
For example, you need root access
in order to start a web server.

89
00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:37.390
However, you don't need special privileges
to start normal applications like

90
00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:38.450
the web browser for instance.

91
00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.490
The prompts can vary
greatly in appearance.

92
00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:48.030
Sometimes the are very simple, the are
only one character in length like a $.

93
00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:51.080
Sometimes the contain more
useful information such as

94
00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:55.135
the account your using, the name of
the server that you're connected to, and

95
00:05:55.135 --> 00:05:57.675
the directory that you're currently in.

96
00:05:57.675 --> 00:06:00.825
In couple of these prompts,
you'll notice a tilde.

97
00:06:00.825 --> 00:06:05.265
The tilde is a shorthand way of
representing a home directory.

98
00:06:05.265 --> 00:06:08.735
The tilde used by itself
represents your home directory, or

99
00:06:08.735 --> 00:06:11.830
the current account's home
directory that you're using.

100
00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:15.508
For example, if I'm logged into
a Linux system with a jason account,

101
00:06:15.508 --> 00:06:19.710
~ represents /home/jason.

102
00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:22.040
You can also append a user name to the ~.

103
00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:26.110
And that will expand to that
account's home directory.

104
00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:31.770
For example,
~pat could expand to /home/pat.

105
00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:38.621
Root's home directory is typically n/root,
so ~root = /root.

106
00:06:38.621 --> 00:06:43.520
Not all accounts on a Linux systems
are associated with an individual user.

107
00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.790
For example,
services often have their own accounts.

108
00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:52.340
In this case, ~ftp expands to the home
directory of the ftp service account.

109
00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:56.280
Intitalizing /srv/ftp.

110
00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:00.440
So far we've looked at prompts that
are contained within a single line.

111
00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.560
Just know that they can span
multiple lines as well.

112
00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.760
Later in this course, you'll learn to
customize the shell prompt to your liking.

113
00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:13.100
In summary, the shell is a default
user interface for the Linux system.

114
00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:16.390
You're automatically presented with the
shell prompt if you connect to Linux over

115
00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:17.920
the network using SSH.

116
00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:21.220
If you log into the graphical
user environment,

117
00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:25.390
you can start the terminal application
to gain access to the command line.

118
00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:28.180
Root is a special user on a Linux system.

119
00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:30.580
It's the all powerful superuser.

120
00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:34.410
Your day to day activities will be
performed using your regular user account.
