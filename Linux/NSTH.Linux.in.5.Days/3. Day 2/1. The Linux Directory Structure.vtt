00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:06.828
In this lesson we're going to talk about
the Linux directory structure where you

2
00:00:06.828 --> 00:00:10.874
can find different components of the Linux
operating system, and we'll see how

3
00:00:10.874 --> 00:00:14.682
applications can use the same conventions
as the Linux operating system for

4
00:00:14.682 --> 00:00:16.550
their directory structure as well.

5
00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.970
First I'd like to share with
you some of the most common top

6
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.600
level directories that you'll see when
using the Linux operating system.

7
00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.620
There might be several top level
directories to be aware of,

8
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.400
but these first few
are the most important, and

9
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.640
they're the ones that you'll
interact with the most often.

10
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.520
The Linux directory
structure is like a tree.

11
00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.850
The base of the Linux file system
hierarchy begins at the root.

12
00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.230
Directories will start to branch off
the root, but everything starts at root.

13
00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.550
The directory separator in Linux
is symbolized by a forward slash.

14
00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.225
Most of the time we just
abbreviate this to /.

15
00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:02.360
Often root is referred to as slash
since there are no other directories.

16
00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.950
If you hear someone say, look in slash,

17
00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.130
or, that file is in slash,
they are referring to the root directory.

18
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.640
Bin, or /bin, is where you'll find
binary files or executable files.

19
00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.470
Programs are written in source code,
and this is human readable text.

20
00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.760
These text files are then compiled
into machine readable binaries.

21
00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.100
They are called binaries because machine
code is a string of zeros and ones.

22
00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.785
Just know that applications that you
can run are sometimes located in /bin.

23
00:01:38.785 --> 00:01:44.980
/etc or etc is where you'll
find configuration files.

24
00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.590
Configuration files control how the
operating system or applications behave.

25
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.410
For example,
there's a configuration file in /etc that

26
00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:00.145
tells the operating system whether to boot
into a text mode or a graphical mode.

27
00:02:00.145 --> 00:02:04.650
/home is where user home directories live.

28
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.410
So for example,
my home directory would be /home/jason.

29
00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.790
Linux systems can and often do have
multiple users or multiple user accounts.

30
00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.270
And the home directory is
where you can separate

31
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.110
your data from another account's data.

32
00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.280
You can store anything you want
to in your home directory.

33
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.760
You could store documents, or
music files, or your vacation pictures.

34
00:02:30.015 --> 00:02:33.375
/opt is where optional or
third party software lives.

35
00:02:33.375 --> 00:02:38.740
/opt is for software that is not
bundled with the operating system.

36
00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:43.950
For example, Google Earth is not part
of the standard Linux operating system.

37
00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.255
So Google Earth gets installed in /opt.

38
00:02:46.255 --> 00:02:52.950
/tmp is call temp and
it's for temporary space.

39
00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:58.920
And most Linux distributions
clear /tmp at boot time.

40
00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.170
So if you put some files in /tmp and
the Linux server gets rebooted or

41
00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.760
your Linux desktop gets rebooted,
your files will be gone.

42
00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.060
Now /tmp is a great place to
store temporary files, but

43
00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.195
do not put anything in /tmp that
you want to keep long term.

44
00:03:16.195 --> 00:03:21.180
/usr is called user, and
this is where user related programs live.

45
00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.780
Each one of these directories
can have subdirectories.

46
00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.360
For example, we already talked
about home/home/username.

47
00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.450
User is no different.

48
00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.450
There will be a subdirectory
structure within user, and

49
00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:42.514
you'll find binary programs and
executables located in /usr/bin, userbin.

50
00:03:42.514 --> 00:03:46.850
/var also called var,
is for variable data.

51
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.320
Think of things that change often.

52
00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.120
Things that change often on a Linux system
are typically log files that are generated

53
00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.019
either by the operating system itself or
applications.

54
00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:01.360
In Linux we typically
talk about directories.

55
00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.580
In other operating systems they make
call the similar concept folders.

56
00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.360
If you think about it in terms of folders,
then slash or

57
00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.260
root is the main folder, and
each one of these are subfolders.

58
00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.700
Again, folder and
directory is often used interchangeably.

59
00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.070
In Linux, again,
we're gonna use the term directory.

60
00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.670
Here's a graphic that illustrates
that each one of the directories

61
00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.590
hang off of slash or start at the root.

62
00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:32.130
This graphic just illustrates that each
directory can have many subdirectories.

63
00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.480
Here's yet another way to visualize this.

64
00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:44.251
And this example we can see /home/jason
as three directories: documents,

65
00:04:44.251 --> 00:04:45.920
downloads and music.

66
00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.850
Up until this point, we've only talked
about a few top level directories.

67
00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:54.140
However, when you actually
get on a live Linux system,

68
00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:57.740
you're going to see that there
are several other top level directories.

69
00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.300
I want to expose you to these
other top level directories so

70
00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.890
that you're slightly familiar
with them when you see them.

71
00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:07.490
On this screen maybe the most interesting
one we see there that we haven't covered

72
00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:10.008
yet is /cdrom.

73
00:05:10.008 --> 00:05:12.930
And oftentimes Linux
distributions will use that

74
00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.370
directory as what's called a mount point.

75
00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:20.200
And when you insert your CD-ROM
it will get mounted on /cdrom.

76
00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:25.095
So, that is where you can access
the files that are located on the CD-ROM.

77
00:05:25.095 --> 00:05:27.875
Other Linux distributions use /media.

78
00:05:27.875 --> 00:05:31.812
Again, this is where you could find
files that are located on CD-ROMs or

79
00:05:31.812 --> 00:05:34.275
DVD's that you place inside your computer.

80
00:05:41.555 --> 00:05:42.830
I've already talked about /opt.

81
00:05:48.032 --> 00:05:52.659
Some Linux operating systems
use /srv as a location to

82
00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:57.280
place data that is served
by the Linux server.

83
00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:01.880
For example,
web files would be an /srv/www.

84
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:07.804
Or if it's an FTP server, maybe
the files would be located in /srv/ftp.

85
00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:15.935
We mentioned earlier about /usr having
subdirectories, /usr/bin, /usr/lib, etc.

86
00:06:21.295 --> 00:06:25.180
Let's switch gears and start talking
about application directory structures.

87
00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:30.050
You'll find that some applications that
are not bundled with the Linux operating

88
00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:32.880
system are installed in /usr/local/,

89
00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:37.120
and often they're installed
in /usr/local/programname/.

90
00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.580
And from there they'll have their
own subdirectory structure.

91
00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:42.275
In this example,

92
00:06:42.275 --> 00:06:47.360
crashplan is backup software that's not
bundled with the Linux operating system.

93
00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.365
If you were to install it from
their website it would install into

94
00:06:50.365 --> 00:06:55.485
/usr/local/crashplan, and
if you wanted to find the binary for

95
00:06:55.485 --> 00:06:59.365
this program, you would look
in /usr/local/crashplan/bin.

96
00:06:59.365 --> 00:07:03.365
If you wanted to configure how
the program behaves at runtime,

97
00:07:03.365 --> 00:07:09.887
you would modify configuration files that
are located in /usr/local/crashplan/etc.

98
00:07:09.887 --> 00:07:13.505
If you wanted to see the log files
that the program is generating, again,

99
00:07:13.505 --> 00:07:18.560
look in log, /usr/local/crashplan/log.

100
00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:22.331
We've already talked about how
applications can be installed in /opt.

101
00:07:22.331 --> 00:07:28.150
Avg is antivirus software, it's not
bundled with the Linux operating system.

102
00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:32.900
And this particular application
installs in /opt/avg.

103
00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:36.400
Again, this is a common pattern,
opt, program name, bin.

104
00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:42.440
Here is a slight variation that you'll
sometimes see applications follow.

105
00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:48.050
Let's take this fictitious
application called myapp for example.

106
00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:52.930
Even though the main myapp program gets
installed in /opt/myapp, where maybe

107
00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:57.300
the binaries live and the libraries live,
you'll also see that it can

108
00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:02.760
install files in /etc/opt/myapp and that's
where you'd find the configure files.

109
00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:08.910
The log files would be in /var/opt/myapp.

110
00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:11.080
Sometimes when applications get installed,

111
00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:13.710
they're not given their
own directory structure.

112
00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:15.840
They're installed in a shared manner.

113
00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:19.350
So maybe myapp gets install in /usr/local.

114
00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:22.920
And in this case it would
be /user/local/bin/myapp.

115
00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:27.425
And the configuration file could
be /user/local/etc/myapp.com.

116
00:08:27.425 --> 00:08:30.660
/usr/loc/bin would not
only contain my app but

117
00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:34.020
other applications that were
installed in this shared manner.

118
00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:39.030
Another common practice is to use opt
company name, or opt organization name.

119
00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:44.340
For example, if you work for the Acme
Corporation and you logged onto one of

120
00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:48.590
their Linux servers, you may see
something like /opt/acme/bin where

121
00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:52.640
the software that was written for that
company or by that company is installed.

122
00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:57.890
Another slight variation on this theme
is opt, company name, product name.

123
00:08:57.890 --> 00:09:00.170
A real life example is Google.

124
00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:05.180
When you install Google Chrome on Linux
it installs into /opt/google/chrome.

125
00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:08.410
Earth installs to /opt/google/earth.

126
00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:12.193
Here's yet another slight variation,
opt/organization name, or

127
00:09:12.193 --> 00:09:17.460
opt/company/ organization name, or even
user/local/company name/organization name.

128
00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:23.880
The most important thing to know about
applications that are not shipped

129
00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:29.159
with the Linux operating system is
that they're typically found in /opt,

130
00:09:29.159 --> 00:09:31.820
called opt or in /usr, called user.

131
00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:33.770
And when these applications are installed,

132
00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:39.019
they're typically installed in user local,
/usr/local.

133
00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:45.593
The most common top level
directories that you'll

134
00:09:45.593 --> 00:09:51.485
interact with on a Linux system are /,
also called root,

135
00:09:51.485 --> 00:09:56.200
bin, etc, home, opt, tmp, usr, and var.

136
00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:59.390
And applications that are not shipped
with the operating system are typically

137
00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:02.335
installed in /usr/local and /opt.
