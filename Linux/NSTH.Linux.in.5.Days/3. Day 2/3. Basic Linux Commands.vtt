00:00:02.872 --> 00:00:08.160
In today's lesson, we're going to cover
some basic yet essential Linux commands.

2
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.990
Commands in Linux are case sensitive.

3
00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:16.400
So, lowercase ls is not the same
as capital L, capital S.

4
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.600
This really isn't much of an issue because
most commands in Linux are all lowercase.

5
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.490
Here are the commands we're
going to cover today.

6
00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:26.620
Ls lists directory contents.

7
00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:30.520
It can also display detailed information
about files and directories.

8
00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.920
Cd is the change directory command.

9
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.210
It does what it says,
it changes the current working directory.

10
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.990
When you log into a Linux system
you're automatically placed into

11
00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:42.380
your home directory.

12
00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.340
You can use the CD command to
navigate around the file system.

13
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.080
The pwd command displays
the present working directory, or

14
00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.040
your current directory.

15
00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.280
Cat concatenates files.

16
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.550
Really, what cat does is it
displays the contents of files.

17
00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.460
Echo displays arguments to the screen.

18
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.160
It may not be immediately obvious how
this is helpful, but in a minute,

19
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.420
when I show you some examples,
it will become clear.

20
00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.910
Linux systems come with
built-in documentation.

21
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.560
You can use man to display
the documentation for

22
00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.950
a given command on the Linux system.

23
00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.630
You may hear people refer to man pages.

24
00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.160
This is the documentation that you
can view with the man command.

25
00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.350
To exit or log out of your shell,
use the exit command.

26
00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.040
Finally, clear clears the screen.

27
00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.480
Let's see some of these
commands in action.

28
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.260
First let's look at ls.

29
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.690
If you run ls without any arguments,

30
00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.800
it lists the files in
the present working directory.

31
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.320
In this example, we see several
items in this directory, desktop,

32
00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.650
downloads, notes, etc.

33
00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.970
In this example, ls output is color coded.

34
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.530
This may not always be the case, but

35
00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.090
it is a common thing to see
on Linux distributions.

36
00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.360
We can run ls with a -l option,
which displays a long listing format.

37
00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.730
Here, we get more information about the
files and directories that are displayed.

38
00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.070
In a later lesson, we'll cover
what all this information means.

39
00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.640
As you recall earlier,
I said Linux commands are case sensitive.

40
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.152
So, let's see what happens
if we type in capital LS.

41
00:02:22.152 --> 00:02:25.152
We get an error saying that
the command is not found.

42
00:02:25.152 --> 00:02:30.370
Let's try capital L lower case s,
lower case l capital S.

43
00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:31.320
Same thing.

44
00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.970
So, ls works, lower case capital does not.

45
00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.190
Let's use the cd command
to change the directory.

46
00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.000
Directories and
files are also case sensitive, so

47
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.796
capital TPS lower case reports is not
the same as all lower case tps reports.

48
00:02:49.886 --> 00:02:54.115
We can use ls to see what's in
this directory, and we can use

49
00:02:54.115 --> 00:02:59.100
ls-l to display a long listing, more
detailed information about these files.

50
00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.090
Cat will display the contents of a file.

51
00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.960
This file only has one line in it.

52
00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.425
Echo is used to display
the contents of variables, and

53
00:03:09.425 --> 00:03:12.465
we'll be talking about
environmental variables later on.

54
00:03:18.245 --> 00:03:22.058
Use the man command to learn more
information about how to use a particular

55
00:03:22.058 --> 00:03:23.150
command.

56
00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.410
Type the word man, space and
the command you want to know more about.

57
00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.340
In order to display the next page of
information, simply hit the space bar.

58
00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.780
When you're done looking at the man page,
type q to quite man.

59
00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.420
Here's the man page for ls.

60
00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.300
You'll see ls has a lot of options.

61
00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.970
Here's one that we've been using in this
lesson, -l, use a long listing format.

62
00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.810
So, as you can see, there's a lot
of information in the man pages.

63
00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.330
We'll talk more about the man
command in the next lesson.

64
00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.670
The clear command clears the screen.

65
00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.960
If you execute cd without any arguments,
it takes you back to your home directory.

66
00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.830
Pwd will display your current or
present working directory.

67
00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.995
In order to exit your session,
type the word exit.

68
00:04:14.995 --> 00:04:17.401
Today the commands we've
talked about are ls,

69
00:04:17.401 --> 00:04:19.695
which displays the contents
of a directory.

70
00:04:19.695 --> 00:04:22.715
Cd, which changes the current directory.

71
00:04:22.715 --> 00:04:26.595
Pwd, which displays what
directory you're currently in.

72
00:04:26.595 --> 00:04:29.516
Cat, that displays the contents of files.

73
00:04:29.516 --> 00:04:32.096
Echo displays arguments.

74
00:04:32.096 --> 00:04:36.580
Man displays documentation about commands.

75
00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.470
Exit, exits your shell.

76
00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:39.950
And clear, clears your screen.

77
00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.850
Start becoming familiar
with these commands.

78
00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:46.920
These are simple and basic, but
yet you'll use these often.

79
00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.320
If you'd like,
you can look at the man page for ls and

80
00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.800
start exploring some of
the options that it has to offer.

81
00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.630
We'll be covering some of the more
important options to ls in a later lesson.

82
00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.750
However, this will just give you some
practice at using the man command, and

83
00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:02.758
navigating within man.
