00:00:02.901 --> 00:00:07.290
In this lesson we're going to talk about
various graphical editors available in

2
00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:08.920
the Linux operating system.

3
00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.280
So far you've learned about command
line editors that are appropriate to

4
00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.150
use when you connect
to a server via SSH or

5
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.810
when you're using a terminal
emulator application.

6
00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.590
If you're running Linux as
a desktop operating system,

7
00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.014
you also have access to graphical editors.

8
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.970
emacs not only works at the command line
but it also has a graphical mode as well.

9
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.310
gedit is the default text editor for
the Gnome desktop environment.

10
00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:34.770
It's very similar to Notepad.

11
00:00:36.585 --> 00:00:39.480
gvim is the graphical version of vim.

12
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.490
kedit is similar to gedit,
it's the default editor for

13
00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.190
the KDE desktop environment.

14
00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:49.050
If you are looking for

15
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.620
a Microsoft Word replacement,
consider AbiWord or LibreOffice.

16
00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.380
LibreOffice not only includes
a word processor, but

17
00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.300
it's a complete office suite.

18
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.770
It contains a spreadsheet,
a database and presentation software.

19
00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:04.470
If you're looking for

20
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.090
a source code editor to help in computer
programming look at an editor like Kate.

21
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.200
There are other option available like
Geany or jEdit or even Sublime Text.

22
00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.170
This is the CentOS distribution
with a known desktop environment.

23
00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.530
Let's look at the default text editor for
Gnome.

24
00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:24.380
Which is gedit.

25
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.380
It's a fairly simple text editor but
it gets the job done.

26
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:31.421
I'll open up a file.

27
00:01:39.082 --> 00:01:43.960
Click on save to save and
we'll go ahead and close out this program.

28
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.860
emacs also has a graphical mode.

29
00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.530
All the key bindings work like they
do in the command line mode but

30
00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.900
with a graphical mode you also will
have access to a menu and a tool bar.

31
00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.770
So just like the other text editor,
we can open up a file, and Ctrl+E

32
00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.740
will work to take us to the end of the
line like we were in command line mode.

33
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.662
Do File > Save.

34
00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.240
Let's look at the graphical
version of vim.

35
00:02:34.981 --> 00:02:38.307
Again that key strokes that work
on command line version of VI,

36
00:02:38.307 --> 00:02:40.263
also work in the graphical version.

37
00:02:46.401 --> 00:02:48.141
Type write to write a file.

38
00:02:48.141 --> 00:02:49.862
I'll leave an exit with Q.

39
00:02:52.081 --> 00:02:54.101
Libre Office is an office suite.

40
00:02:54.101 --> 00:02:58.801
Let's look at the text editor first.

41
00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.641
It's very similar to Microsoft Word.

42
00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.561
We'll close out this application.

43
00:03:22.561 --> 00:03:24.381
Let's look at the spreadsheet program.

44
00:03:24.381 --> 00:03:25.361
Calc.

45
00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.521
There's also presentation software.

46
00:03:52.841 --> 00:03:58.241
There are a variety of text editors and
word processors for Linux.

47
00:03:58.241 --> 00:04:01.021
emacs and
vi both have graphical counterparts.

48
00:04:01.021 --> 00:04:04.735
Sometimes you may not have access
to a graphical environment for

49
00:04:04.735 --> 00:04:07.910
example when you're connecting
to a server over SSH.

50
00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.890
In that instance you have to
use a command line editor.

51
00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.475
However if you do have access
to the Linux desktop and

52
00:04:14.475 --> 00:04:18.320
graphic environment feel free to use
a graphical text editor of your choice.
