00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:06.220
>> In today's lesson we'll be
learning how to use the Emacs editor.

2
00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:11.720
Emacs, like vi, is a powerful editor.

3
00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.800
Some people prefer vi,
others prefer Emacs.

4
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.410
My recommendation to you is to experiment
with the Emacs editor and the vi editor,

5
00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.220
and see which one you feel
more comfortable with.

6
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.779
You can't make a bad choice.

7
00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.960
To edit a file with Emacs, run Emacs and

8
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.110
provide it the file name
that you wish to edit.

9
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.940
When you look at the Emacs documentation,
you'll see C dash character.

10
00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.008
This means to hold down the control
key while pressing that character.

11
00:00:41.008 --> 00:00:46.605
For example, C dash H means to hold down
the control key while pressing the H key.

12
00:00:46.605 --> 00:00:50.880
</char> We see C dash H space T.

13
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.060
That means to hold down the Ctrl
key while pressing the H key.

14
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.860
Release the Ctrl key and
then type the letter T.

15
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.810
When you see M dash character,
that means to hold down the Meta key.

16
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.650
The Meta key is the Alt key.

17
00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.720
You can also substitute the escape key for
the alt key.

18
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.770
For example, M dash F translates
to holding down the alt key and

19
00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:19.090
pressing F or pressing and
releasing escape followed by the F key.

20
00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.460
You may need to use the escape
key as the meta key,

21
00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.880
since alt can sometimes be intercepted
by your terminal program, for instance.

22
00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.460
If you want to simplify things just always
use the escape key for the meta key.

23
00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.530
Use control H to get help.

24
00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.200
Type control X followed by
control C to exit Emacs.

25
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.370
Control X, control S, saves the file.

26
00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.270
Control H, T,
will start the built in tutorial.

27
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.730
Ctrl H, K followed by a key
will describe that key.

28
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.320
You can use this to get help on a specific
key command or key combination.

29
00:01:54.835 --> 00:01:58.020
Control P will take you to
the previous line while contril

30
00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.345
N will take you to the next line.

31
00:02:00.345 --> 00:02:03.295
Control B is to go backward one character.

32
00:02:03.295 --> 00:02:06.530
Control F is to go forward one character.

33
00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:12.070
Meta F will move you forward one word,
and meta B will take you back one word.

34
00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.750
Control A will take you to
the beginning of the line.

35
00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.775
Control E will take you
to the end of a line.

36
00:02:19.775 --> 00:02:23.360
Meta less than will take you to
the beginning of the file, and

37
00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.030
meta followed by the greater than symbol
will take you to the end of the file.

38
00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.917
To delete a character, type control D,
to delete a word it's meta D.

39
00:02:32.917 --> 00:02:36.880
Control K will kill the rest
of the current line.

40
00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.490
To kill the entire line, just position the
cursor at the beginning of the line and

41
00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.060
type Control K.

42
00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.710
In VI yank means to copy,
in Emacs yank means to paste.

43
00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:53.880
So control Y means to yank or
paste from the previously killed text.

44
00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.090
To undo, type control X, U.

45
00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.040
Control S will start a forward search.

46
00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.260
Type the text you're looking for, and

47
00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.110
type Control S again to move to
the next occurrence of that text.

48
00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.735
Press enter when you're done searching.

49
00:03:08.735 --> 00:03:11.550
Control R starts a reverse search.

50
00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.780
Like VI,
Emacs provides a way to repeat commands.

51
00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:22.380
For instance, to kill three lines of text,
type Control U, three, Control K.

52
00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:23.996
Let's edit a file with emacs.

53
00:03:23.996 --> 00:03:29.750
We'll do file dot text.

54
00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.087
To navigate, we can use control
N to go to the next slide, and

55
00:03:34.087 --> 00:03:37.685
control F will go forward one character.

56
00:03:37.685 --> 00:03:40.922
Control P will go previous slide.

57
00:03:40.922 --> 00:03:44.340
Control B will go back a character.

58
00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.160
To get to the beginning of the line,
type Control A, and

59
00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.330
to the end, Control E.

60
00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.655
And you can just start typing
text wherever your cursor is.

61
00:03:56.655 --> 00:04:00.611
[SOUND] Let's delete

62
00:04:00.611 --> 00:04:06.201
a character with control D.

63
00:04:06.201 --> 00:04:12.761
To delete a word type meta D.

64
00:04:12.761 --> 00:04:17.861
Then I can use alt D or

65
00:04:17.861 --> 00:04:20.590
Escape D.

66
00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.773
Let's kill a line of text with control K,

67
00:04:23.773 --> 00:04:27.820
and I'll move to the bottom of
the file and yank it, or paste it in.

68
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.450
Let's start a search.

69
00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:32.862
Let's search for the.

70
00:04:32.862 --> 00:04:38.340
Control S will take you
to the next occurrence,

71
00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.610
and then when you're done,
you can just hit enter.

72
00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:46.000
And if we do a reverse search,
we can do that with control R.

73
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.067
Let's do the same thing.

74
00:04:47.067 --> 00:04:50.715
Control R takes you to the previous one,
and when you're done, you can hit enter.

75
00:04:50.715 --> 00:04:53.927
To exit, control X, control C.

76
00:04:53.927 --> 00:04:57.889
And I'm not going to save my changes.

77
00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.988
Let's get back into Emacs again.

78
00:05:06.988 --> 00:05:14.552
[SOUND] And we can save the file
with control X, control S.

79
00:05:14.552 --> 00:05:17.877
Again, to exit, control X, control C.

80
00:05:17.877 --> 00:05:22.020
Emacs is a more powerful editor than nano.

81
00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.670
Emacs is also an alternative for vi.

82
00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:28.200
Again some people prefer vi,
others prefer Emacs.

83
00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.980
I suggest you try them both and
see what you feel comfortable with.

84
00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:35.590
I also suggest that you take
the tutorial by starting Emacs and

85
00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:40.745
pressing control H, T.
