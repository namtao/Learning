00:00:03.052 --> 00:00:07.438
In this lesson we'll look at Different
ways to display the contents of files and

2
00:00:07.438 --> 00:00:08.950
how to use the Nano editor.

3
00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:13.860
You can use the cat command to
display the entire contents of a file.

4
00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:19.810
The more command will allow you to browse
through a file or page through a file.

5
00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:25.580
The less command is like more except
is has more features, less is more.

6
00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:31.210
When using the commands more or less, use
the Space bar to advance to the next page.

7
00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:36.090
Use the Enter key to advance one line and
type Q to quit viewing the file.

8
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.130
The commands are based on the VI editor,

9
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.020
which we'll be covering
later in this lesson.

10
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:45.210
By default head and
tail only display ten lines.

11
00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.080
So if you wanted to see the last
15 lines of a file for example,

12
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:54.250
you could use tail -15
space the file name.

13
00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.490
The cat command can be a fine way to
view files that have static content.

14
00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:03.930
However, if you're trying to keep up with
changes that are being made to a file in

15
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.620
real time, cat's not your choice.

16
00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.040
You should use tail -f
followed by the file name.

17
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:17.210
You would use this to look at files that
change often, for example, log files.

18
00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.350
You may wanna start a program and

19
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.690
look at the program's log file
to see exactly what it's doing.

20
00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.740
Again in this case use tail -f and
the file you want to follow.

21
00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.450
Let's look at this file
with the cat command.

22
00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:37.690
If we run head against that file, we
will see the top ten lines of that file.

23
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.294
If we only wanted to see the top
two lines, we could run -2.

24
00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.470
And a tail command will display
the last ten lines in that file.

25
00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.580
Let's say we only want to
look at the last line.

26
00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:54.825
We could do tail -1.

27
00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.780
And that's the last line of the file.

28
00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.750
Let's run more against this file here.

29
00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.510
We can see some information.

30
00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.050
It's the first page of the file.

31
00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.780
If you want to get to the next
page just hit the space bar.

32
00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.370
Space bar again for another page.

33
00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.710
If you wanna go down just
one line hit the Enter key.

34
00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:29.870
That's one line.

35
00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.100
Another line.

36
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.540
Another line.

37
00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.240
And to quit, you just type Q.

38
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.040
The less command is very similar.

39
00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.860
Again, space bar goes down a page.

40
00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.660
The Enter key, down one line,
and Q to quit.

41
00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.960
Now this file is growing so
lets take a look at this.

42
00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:57.270
We will use -f with tail
to follow the file.

43
00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.884
As you can see,
the file is being written to and

44
00:02:59.884 --> 00:03:03.583
the screen gets updated with that
information as the file grows.

45
00:03:07.665 --> 00:03:10.505
To exit, just type Ctrl+C.

46
00:03:10.505 --> 00:03:13.309
If you need to edit a file right now and

47
00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:19.540
don't wanna spend any time learning
an obscure editor, you use Nano.

48
00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.330
Nano is a clone of pico, so if for some
reason the Nano command isn't available,

49
00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:25.250
try pico.

50
00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:27.750
It's very easy to learn but

51
00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.930
it's not as advanced as some of
the other editors like vi or emacs.

52
00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.930
Let's edit this file in Nano.

53
00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.650
Nano file.txt.

54
00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.610
So when you start Nano you can
see the file's contents and

55
00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.520
a list of commands at
the bottom of your screen.

56
00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:50.180
The carrot symbol
represents a control key.

57
00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.260
So if we look in the bottom
left hand corner.

58
00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.720
Which means Ctrl+X to exit.

59
00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:56.475
I'll do that now.

60
00:03:56.475 --> 00:04:00.650
Ctrl+X and we are existed out of Nano.

61
00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:04.530
So let's go back in.

62
00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.220
Editing with nano is pretty easy.

63
00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.940
Arrow keys work as you would expect.

64
00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:16.440
Down, right, up, left.

65
00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.370
If you want to save a file hit Ctrl+O and
hit Enter.

66
00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.320
Let's make some modifications.

67
00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.665
So again, just place your cursor wherever
you want to go and start typing there.

68
00:04:28.665 --> 00:04:31.889
[SOUND]
And

69
00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:37.935
Ctrl+X to exit.

70
00:04:37.935 --> 00:04:40.295
And it says,
do you want to save your changes or not?

71
00:04:40.295 --> 00:04:42.165
In this case, we'll say No.

72
00:04:42.165 --> 00:04:46.125
[SOUND] And go back in again.

73
00:04:46.125 --> 00:04:50.320
And another important thing to
point out is Ctrl+G, to get help.

74
00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.530
And this will show you more
information about how to use Nano.

75
00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.830
There are various commands that you can
use to display the contents of files

76
00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:08.550
including cat, head, tail, more, and less.

77
00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:12.404
The Nano editor may not be extremely
powerful but it is easy to use and

78
00:05:12.404 --> 00:05:15.046
you can learn it in a very
short amount of time.
